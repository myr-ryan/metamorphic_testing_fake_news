““But in the end [the all-white] was perfect because it created a solid look.”Tortorella called the gowns “timeless androgynous paraphernalia mimicking Romanesque sculpture that fluidly blends masculine and feminine.” He added, “The looks are everything we’ve ever dreamed of.””
““I did try to convince them to incorporate some black in their look,” Morrison says with a laugh, saying that he was surprised they wanted traditional white.”
“He also incorporated a cashmere turtleneck for Tortorella to wear under his dress, as well as trousers for both the bride and groom.”
“The designer — who specializes in formal unisex clothing — ended up making them gossamer white Grecian gowns made of draped silk jersey, inspired by Cate Blanchett’s ethereal elvin character in the “Lord of the Rings” films.”
“The couple reached out to Morrison, a longtime friend, about 6 weeks prior to their nuptials.”
““In this relationship, we both wear the pants and the dress,” writes Tortorella in an essay the couple penned for LBGTQ website them.”
““But previously I’ve dressed either the bride or the groom — this is the first time I’ve dressed both [partners].”The 29-year-old Tortorella, who opened up about his bisexuality to Alexa, and Meyers, a fitness instructor, wanted their outfits to reflect their unconventional union.”
““This is the third wedding that I’ve done,” Morrison, who started his eponymous made-to-order line in 2015, tells the Post.”
“That was the challenge designer Andrew Morrison faced when “Younger” star Nico Tortorella approached him about creating matching ensembles for him and his partner of 11 years, Bethany Meyers, for their March nuptials.”
“The answer is: definitely not a basic mermaid gown or a tux.”


"But ultimately (all white) is perfect because it creates a solid look." Torrera called these dresses "tools of eternal androgyny, imitating Roman sculpture, and smoothly integrating men and women." He added, "appearance is everything we ever dreamed of."
"I did try to persuade them to add some black to their looks, and he said he was surprised they wanted the traditional white," Morrison said with a smile
He also designed a cashmere turtleneck for tortorella to wear under a skirt, and pants for the bride and groom
The designer, who specializes in formal men's and women's clothing design, eventually turned them into gauze like white Greek robes made of pleated Silk Knits, inspired by Kate Blanchett's elegant Elvin character in the Lord of the rings movie
"The couple contacted their old friend Morrison about six weeks before the wedding."
"In this relationship, we all wear pants and skirts," totorella wrote in an article for lbgtq website them
"But before I dressed either the bride or the groom - for the first time I dressed both of them." Torrella, 29, has revealed her bisexuality to Aleksa, and fitness coach Meyers wants their clothes to reflect their unconventional Union
"This is my third wedding," Morrison told the post, starting his own customized series of the same name in 2015
"It's a challenge for Andrew Morrison, the designer, when Nico tortorella, the star of young people, came to him to make a ensemble for his wedding in March with his partner of 11 years, Bethany Meyers."
"The answer is: definitely not a basic Mermaid Dress or tuxedo."

“Despite gaining support from other artists such as 50 Cent, who called the accusations a "money play," Songz still has several accusations against him from multiple women.”

"But in this case, it seems easy for him to get out."
"Despite the support of other artists, such as 50 cent, who call these accusations" money games ", there are still several accusations made against him by a number of women," he said
"In his only statement on the situation, sonzi claimed that he was" deceived and framed for someone's personal benefit. "
"Since then, sonzi has been forced to turn himself in to the police and released from prison on a $50000 bond."
"She also confirmed that she had received a temporary restraining order against sonzi."
"This attack was first reported in February this year. Buela held a press conference in early March, at which she claimed that buela had beaten her too hard and had to send her to the hospital."
"According to reports, sonzi's lawyer produced several eyewitness statements that contradicted buela's statement, as well as other information that damaged buela's credibility."
"According to TMZ, the Los Angeles District Attorney didn't believe in the validity of the case, so he dropped the felony charges against the singer."

"Ratner, through his lawyer, Martin Singh, challenges these claims."
"A few years later, Munn said she met Ratner at a CAA party, where Ratner boasted about ejaculation and showed her image on the cover of the magazine."
"Actresses Natasha henstridge and Olivia Munn were also among those who accused Ratner of" forcing her to have oral sex, "while Munn said she masturbated in front of her in a trailer when she went to deliver dinner
Ratner was the film's director and Hefner was an executive producer before his death on September 27
"As the wrap reported for the first time, Playboy shelved all the projects between their production banner Alta Loma entertainment and Ratner's ratpac dune entertainment."
"Read another: before Playboy shelved Brett Ratner's Hugh Hefner biography (exclusive), the Los Angeles Times published the exposure of Ratner, in which six women accused him of sexual harassment and assault."
"A person familiar with the matter told the wrap that the confusion stemmed from Ratner's reference to talks with Leto at an event, but he said no official agreement had ever been reached."
"Earlier reports were incorrect and not confirmed by his representatives," Leto's representative said in a statement
"Jared Leto doesn't like or used to like Brett Ratner's Hugh Hefner films and won't work with him in the future."
"The representative of Oscar winner Jared Leto said the report that he played Hugh Hefner in Brett Ratner's biography of the founder of Playboy was wrong."

But for Drew Barrymore, her instagram trolls forced her to cut her hair seven inches because of their "mean, cruel, ugly" comments
"(photo: instagram) so, what caused the chaos?"
"Well, the actress went to instagram on November 4 to promote a new product of her beauty brand flower beauty."
In the video, Barrymore is keen on the new mixture and matte lipstick, and compares the color of her new lipstick to the starfish, saying: "I share the same brilliance with my starfish friend."
"I'm so inspired! "But the reaction of the fans is not what Barrymore expected."
Instead, they said in the comments that the actress "hurt" starfish and did not respect them
"Animals, like humans, deserve respect," wrote one commentator

“I would recommend having them both in your beauty arsenal because as the seasons change, it’s always great to have options!”
“So how do they differ you ask?”
“When some women think of foundation think of a heavy cover up that masks their skin, but that simply isn’t true.”
“Foundation has advanced just like everything else.”
“It now has ingredients that help with anti-aging and acne reduction, in addition to coming in light-weight, air-whipped formulas – it’s much more than a cover up for imperfections!”
“But then of course there is a surge of tinted moisturizers that claim to hydrate the skin while simultaneously evening out your skin tone… Okay, now it really got confusing!”
“First, let’s figure out how they’re similar.”
“Both foundation and tinted moisturizers contain a solvent (water), mixtures of humectants (chemicals that bind water to your skin) and emollients (oily chemicals that smooth the skin and create a moisture barrier).”
“We all know from elementary school that oil and water don’t mix so they both contain surfactants to keep the water and oil-soluble ingredients mixed together in a creamy base.”
“Like most products on the shelf, they both have preservatives to keep them from spoiling – who wants to put moldy foundation or tinted moisturizer on – yuck!!”


"I suggest you put them all in your beauty library, because with the change of season, it's always good to have a choice!"
"So you ask them what's the difference?"
"When some women think of foundations, they think of a heavy cover that covers their skin, but that's not true."
"The foundation has improved as much as anything else."
"It's now made with ingredients that help fight aging and reduce acne, as well as a lightweight air blend formula - it's not just about covering up defects!"
"But of course there are plenty of colored moisturizers that claim to moisturize your skin and improve your complexion Well, it's really confusing now! "
"First, let's find out the similarities."
Both basic and tinted moisturizers contain a solvent (water), a moisturizer (a chemical that binds water to the skin) and a emollient (an oily chemical that smoothes the skin and creates a moisture barrier).
"We've known since primary school that oil and water don't mix, so they all contain surfactants that make water and oil soluble ingredients mix together to form a creamy base."
Like most products on shelves, they all have preservatives to prevent them from deteriorating. Who wants to put mouldy foundation or coloring moisturizers on top?

““There’s always room for our film and television, for our art, to be more representative of who we are as a culture.”
“The series, which is part of ABC's popular T.G.I.T Thursday night lineup, has been a hit for the network and has helped secure Rhimes' dominance and make a big name out of star Kerry Washington, who plays Washington D.C.'s "fixer" Olivia Pope.”
“This should not come as a huge surprise to big Shondaland fans, as Rhimes herself said that the show would have a shorter shelf life than her original hit, Grey's Anatomy, which is now in its 13th season.”
“"I feel like there is a finite amount of Scandal to be told," she told NPR in 2013.”
“"So I know what the end of Scandal will be, and I feel really good about that.”
“And I can see where the end point is."”
“Thus the show's conclusion was the decision of Rhimes, not the network.”
“Among the advertiser-coveted 18 to 49 demographic, the show was among the 20 highest-rated shows of 2016.”
“The current season averages 5.699 million viewers and 1.46 viewers in the 18-49 demo.”

““He set a great tone and no, they both came to work on time, did great work and there was never any undercurrent of tension that I witnessed.”However, just because the White Collar alum wasn’t privy to the drama, that doesn’t mean there wasn’t any!”

“That was also where she publicly rebuked West’s lyric about her in her acceptance speech.”
“Photograph: YoutubeIt was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public’s patience.”
“And if the images could talk, they might say, “I know what you think of me”, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: “I’m a messy bitch who lives for drama.”But still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded.”
“But it doesn’t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images.”
“The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it’s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyoncé dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes.”
“The music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night’s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that’s mostly eluded her.”
“But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation.”
“So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red.”
““Because she’s dead.”In the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter.”
“Why?”


"This is also her acceptance speech publicly accused west of her lyricism."
"Photo: YouTube it beat Kendrick Lamar at the 2016 Grammy Awards in 1989 to pimp the album of the year, which is the first time swift has really begun to test the public's patience."
"If these images could speak, they might say," I know what you think of me, "or, in the words of the liar Joanne," I'm a slovenly bitch born for drama. " However, in all these images, swift left a lot to be interpreted. "
"But it's just a series of disconnected images."
"This video is interesting, if a bit crazy; it must be Beyonce's most brazen and ambitious pop music video since she threw lemonade last spring, full of fireworks and dozens of clothing changes."
"When lwymmd's music video premiered at Vmas on Sunday night, she saw Swift's double blow of revenge, turning her scandalous career into a drama, trying to convey a sense of self that she hardly realized."
"But the old swift is damned, this new one is all retribution and, as the title of her upcoming album shows, reputation."
"Even hearing her new single reminds me of the days of fearlessness and red."
"Because she's dead." In the battle between swifts, I am loyal to the late version, a shrewd young man, courtship chronicler and experienced star eyed songwriter

“We’re gonna have to do a simulation.”Hold on.”
“So Phelps wasn’t going to actually race a shark in a TV event titled “Phelps vs. Shark: Great Gold vs. Great White”?!”
“Why was the hour-long special billed as such?”
“ADWhile common sense probably could have saved any disappointment — along with preshow interviews where Phelps assured everyone that he wouldn’t really race next to a shark in open water — many viewers were not pleased.”
“Throughout the episode, viewers watched as Gutteridge and the team collected data about the swim speed of sharks, which is apparently very hard to do, because sharks don’t typically swim in a straight line.”
“ADSo, Gutteridge said, instead of Phelps and a shark swimming side by side, the scientists would use the speed data they obtained to create a computer-generated image of a shark racing.”
“And Phelps would compete against that.”
“Unacceptable, said the Internet.”


“… Well, there may be a turning point that makes it less exciting because it seems... "
"At least discovery has a sense of humor for this special program. For example, when the commentator mentioned many Olympic honors of Phelps, sharks didn't care about medals. For those who are still upset about the situation of CGI sharks, just remember, whenever discovery hypes up crazy things that happen to animals..."
"We have to do a simulation." wait
So Phelps doesn't plan to compete with sharks in a TV show called "Phelps vs. sharks: Gold vs. white shark"
"Why do you charge for this hour's special?"
"While common sense may have avoided any disappointment - and Phelps assured everyone that he would not really be interviewing sharks in open water - many viewers were not satisfied."
"Throughout the episode, the audience is watching guteridge and the team collect data about the speed of sharks swimming, which is obviously difficult to do because sharks usually don't swim in a straight line."
Instead of Phelps swimming side by side with a shark, scientists will use the speed data they get to create a computer-generated image of the game, gutrich said

“Here's how Meghan's minimalist pieces stack up:”
“"She really likes matching sets of jewelry, but Meghan is much trendier ... a little less in that traditional English, royal mode. "”
“"People compare her a lot to Kate [Middleton] obviously, and Kate tends to wear slightly larger, more colorful pieces," says royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of The Court Jeweller.”
“On the other hand, the Duchess of Cambridge favors jewelry that's a little bigger than whisper-thin.”
“In fact, you have to really zero in on photos to catch a clear glimpse of what she wore.”
“Her penchant for minimal, delicate pieces in warm golds puts her at odds with what her new in-laws frequently sport.”
“While she only just gained access to the Queen's vault of jewels — her wedding tiara counted as "something borrowed" — Meghan may refrain from borrowing some of the glitzier pieces.”
“Meghan Markle just added a Welsh gold wedding band to her jewelry box after marrying Prince Harry two weeks ago, but the new Duchess of Sussex already owns quite an array of rings and bangles.”

"Her love of tiny, delicate Warm gold ornaments makes her out of tune with what her new in laws often play with."
"Although she has only just come into contact with the Queen's jewelry store - her wedding headdress is considered a" borrowed thing "- Megan may refrain from borrowing some glittering jewelry."

“Scott made the decision earlier this month to remove Spacey from the crime drama and replace him with Plummer, after Spacey was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct.”
“Despite principal photography for the film having concluded in August, scenes featuring Spacey were reshot at short notice, in order for it to be completed in time for its scheduled US release date of 22 December.”

“If the show is coming back for good this time, it cannot afford to slip for even a moment below the majestic standards of its gilded predecessor.”
“Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror is a relentlessly spiky and unforgiving cultural rectal probe, while Electric Dreams is a cerebrum-twistingly bonkers riff on the late great Philip K Dick’s blend of deep thinking and futuristic whimsy.”
“And who can blame them when the X-Files is currently enjoying a new lease on life, the recent return of Twin Peaks proved such an unexpected joy and even the new version of the 80s shoulderpad-fest Dynasty seems to have found its audience?”
“The Twilight Zone, however, might well be a different matter entirely.”
“According to the Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Peele, the director of Get Out, has been selected to revive the venerable, spooky old sci-fi show for CBS All Access, which one would have to admit makes a certain sort of sense.”
“Peele’s biting, horror-fuelled satire on race and richness would have made a fine episode of Rod Serling’s classic anthology series, as Serling delighted in using pulpy scenarios to brutally satirise the whirling cultural maelstrom of early 1960s society.”
“The question is whether The Twilight Zone can ever return to the intellectual heights that the original series reached over five seasons and a staggering 156 episodes between 1959 and 1964.”
“A previous 1980s revival floundered despite featuring work from celebrated writers such as George RR Martin and Harlan Ellison, and perhaps because it lacked Serling’s knack for balancing shock tactics with a strident morality and subtle liberal message.”
“Even with the presence of American Werewolf in London’s John Landis in the director’s chair and Steven Spielberg as a hands-on producer, the 1983 big screen reworking also failed to pass muster, and is now little-remembered.”
“The most recent revival, on TV between 2002 and 2003, also largely left critics unimpressed despite having recruited Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker to take over Serling’s dutiful presentation and narration.”


"If the show can get back on track forever this time, it can't be lower than the grand standards of gilded predecessors."
"Charlie Brooke's" black mirror "is a merciless cusp and a merciless cultural probe, while" electric dream "is the late great Philip K. Dick's crazy improvisation of brain distortion, which combines deep thinking and future wishful thinking."
"When X-Files are enjoying a new life, who can blame them? The recent return of bimodal has proved such an unexpected joy that even the new version of paradise on the shoulders in the 1980s seems to have found its audience? "
"The twilight zone, however, is probably quite another story."
"According to the Hollywood Reporter, Jordan peel, the director of going out, has been selected as CBS all access to revive this old and creepy science fiction play. People have to admit that it has a certain significance."
"Pierce's poignant and terrifying satire of race and wealth could have been a good interlude in rod Selin's classic anthology series, because Selin was willing to use vulgar plots to cruelly satirize the whirlpool of culture in the early 1960s."
"The question is whether Twilight can return to the level of intelligence that the original achieved in its five season 156 series from 1959 to 1964."
"Although the revival of the 1980s is characterized by the works of famous writers such as George Martin and Harlan Ellison, it is still difficult. This may be because it lacks the ability of Salin to balance shock tactics with harsh morality and subtle liberal information."
"Even with American Werewolf as director of John Landis in London and Steven Spielberg as actual producer, the 1983 big screen remake failed, and few people remember it now."
"The latest revival, on television between 2002 and 2003, has largely left critics unmoved, even though they recruited Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker to take over from Celine's dedicated speeches and narratives."

“"It's so weird to think, the last time I was in Napa, it was probably the most emotional day of my life," Nikki recalled in a confessional.”
“However, the last time Nikki was there, was when John had called off the wedding.”
“Nikki first traveled to Napa with her sister Brie Bella to work on finalizing their location.”


"At first, I just wanted a few," Nikki said
Although the girls praised Nicky for being so "mature" in her engagement to John, they were not excited about her leading them
"He's making 10000 movies, he's wrestling, he's working in the media, so it's bad, because there's nothing better than being with someone you love and planning a very special day for you."
"I'm really lucky because Brian was really involved in our wedding planning, which made the wedding very interesting, so John was too busy, which made me feel terrible."
"It's hard to see Nicole's wedding plans because she made them herself," Bree said at a confession
Because John is not in the film, Bree has to play the role of a "husband" who holds Nikki together
"But I like what happened before, and it doesn't spoil our present moment."
"It's strange to remember that the last time I was in Napa, it was probably the most emotional day of my life," Nicky recalled at a confession
"But the last time Nicky was there was when John called off the wedding."
"Nikki first went to NAPA with her sister, brie Bella, to work on their final position."

“This time the industry can’t expect us to go up and twirl around.”
“For years, we’ve sold these awards shows as women, with our gowns and colors and our beautiful faces and our glamour.”
“Longoria told The New York Times, “This is a moment of solidarity, not a fashion moment.”
“The all-black fashion statement could be classified as a silent protest, but the purpose is loud and clear: It’s a powerful show of support for the many people who are speaking out against their powerful abusers.”
“Time’s Up is a direct response to the #MeToo movement that has upended industries from politics to Hollywood to restaurants to journalism by exposing sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace—and actually, miraculously, holding abusers accountable.”
“The goal of Time’s Up is to combat inequality, sexual harassment, and sexual assault in the workplace; the movement already has a $14 million legal defense fund.”
“The call to wear black comes from the ambitious Time’s Up initiative, created by 300 actresses and female agents, writers, directors, and executives, including such power players as Eva Longoria, Shonda Rimes, and Reese Witherspoon.”
“But this year, many female celebrities are eschewing the typical brightly colored dresses and statement-making patterns on the red carpet for something more powerful—all black.”
“The Golden Globes marks the start of the 2018 awards season.”

"The goal of time's up is to combat inequality, sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace; the campaign already has $14 million in legal defense funds."
"The call to wear black comes from the ambitious time action plan, which is made up of 300 actresses, brokers, writers, directors and executives, including Eva Longoria, shoda rimes and Reese Witherspoon."

“Do I think it’s TLC?’ … Was I going to say ‘Hit me baby one more time’?”
““I was like: ‘I like the song but do I think it’s a hit?”
“Martin, convinced he’d written an R&B song (“Pop music with a flavour – what we call R&B in Sweden, what you guys [in America] say is pop,” he said in 1998), sent the song, then called Hit Me Baby (One More Time), to TLC who rejected it.”
““I remember listening back to [the tape] after [the song] blew up and you can hear me sort of go: ‘Hit me baby one more time’, then I hear myself say, Yeah, it’s pretty good,’” the notoriously interview-shy Martin told Swedish journalist Jan Gradvall in 2016.”
“Having hauled himself out of bed to his nearby dictaphone, he sketched out the song.”
“...all with the song s melody bubbling up as Martin was drifting off to sleep...”
“It was different and I loved it but I don t think you can anticipate how a song is going to be received In a Sliding Doors esque moment that could have changed the world as we know it Baby One More Time very nearly didn t get written at...”

“…… Martin fell asleep and the melody of the song was boiling... "

“The simplicity of Maud’s gown has been an inspiration for subsequent royal brides.”
“My jewels were my Turkish diamond necklace & earrings & dear Albert’s beautiful sapphire brooch.”Technically, Queen Victoria was not the first royal bride to opt for white – Mary, Queen of Scots wore white on her first wedding day (when she married the future King Francois II of France, in 1558).”
“Victoria described her dress and jewels in her journal: “I wore a white satin dress, with a deep flounce of Honiton lace, an imitation of an old design.”
“Albert of Saxe Coburg Gotha in St James s Palace the young Queen Victoria departed from Hanoverian court tradition by wearing a comparatively simple wedding dress of white silk satin trimmed with lace and orange blossoms...”

“And when Queen Victoria’s cousin Princess Charlotte married the future Leopold I of Belgium on 2 May 1816, the bride wore a glittering ensemble of “silver lama on net, over a silver tissue slip, embroidered at the bottom with silver lama in shells and flowers”.”

Victoria described her dress and jewelry in her diary: "I wore a white satin skirt with a deep hennaton lace ruffle, imitating an old design."
"The young Queen Victoria left the tradition of Hanover palace and wore a relatively simple white satin wedding dress with lace and orange flowers..."
"This dress is the earliest existing royal wedding dress in Britain. It also boasts that manteau is a loose sleeveless cape or a silver Tulle Cape, which is lined with white satin and embroidered on the edge to answer the questions on the dress. But in 1840, her wedding to the prince..."
On May 2, 1816, when Princess Charlotte, the cousin of Queen Victoria, married Leopold I of Belgium, the bride wore a set of glittering "silver lamas on the Internet, which were embroidered with shells and flowers on the bottom of a silver paper towel"
This follows the tradition of Hanover brides, who wear court dresses or royal robes on the wedding day

Warner insisted that after going to the gym many times, she was "stronger mentally and physically than at any time in my life." Warner's trial is scheduled for April
"There's news on Monday."
"According to Warner's lawyer Sean holly, she has been fighting insomnia, which prompted her to receive prescription sleep aids."
Victoria, daughter of "rhony" movie star Luan D'Agostino, was arrested for DWI. "We have letters and reports from Dr. Jackie, which prove Jackie's long history of insomnia, which strongly supports our argument that Jackie lost consciousness while driving after taking prescription drug Ambien," Holley told TMZ
Holly added: "I contacted the district attorney's office a few weeks ago and they assured me that the representatives would review our report before making the charges."
"We are very disappointed that the district attorney's office has made these charges without reviewing our evidence as promised." West Los Angeles Sheriff tells e! "
"No one was injured. The news that Warner's car rolled back prompted it to crash into a police car."
"Warner got out of the car without any problems and was reported to have reached an agreement with officials at the scene before his arrest."
"The police are not sure how the car reversed. The case has been handed over to a detective."

“Thor: Ragnarok, which also stars Jeff Goldblum and Idris Elba, hit theaters November 3.”
“The trailer also sports a different title; the official Japanese title for the Waititi movie is Thor: Battle Royale, which sounds pretty awesome.”
“Here’s a refresher if you forgot:The rest of the trailer jumps right into some of the familiar shots of Cate Blanchett‘s Hela, Thor and Mark Ruffalo‘s the Hulk fist-bumping, Tom Hiddleston‘s Loki all chained up, and Tessa Thompson‘s Valkyrie stealing the show.”
“You may notice that Hemsworth is sporting the same clothing he wore in the Doctor Strange post-credits scene, so it’s safe to assume that conversation will place right after Thor arrives.”
“The Japanese trailer opens with Thor in the Sanctum Sanctorum as the sorcerer flaunts his Cloak of Levitation and telling the God of Thunder that he senses “a great change” in Thor’s future.”
“The latest trailer for the Taika Waititi movie doesn’t feature a ton of new footage, but does give us a look at Doctor Strange dropping in.”
“So it only makes sense that Benedict Cumberbatch‘s Doctor will drop by Thor: Ragnarok.”
“If you stayed for the credits after Doctor Strange last year (of course you did) you saw the titular Sorcerer Supreme have a little sit down with Chris Hemsworth‘s Thor over some beer.”


Raytheon: ragnaro, also starring Jeff Goldbloom and Idris Elba, opens on November 3
The trailer also has a different title; the official Japanese title of the witty movie is Raytheon: the battle of the royal family, which sounds great
"It's a review if you like. Forget: part of the rest of the trailer jumps directly into familiar scenes: HeLa of Kate Blanchett, Thor and the Hulk fist bumping of mark Ruffalo, Tom sidleton Loki in hiddleston is locked up, and Valkyrie in Tessa Thompson is locked up
"You may notice that Hemsworth is wearing the same clothes as he did in strange doctor, so it's certain that the conversation will take place immediately after Thor arrives."
"The Japanese Trailer starts with Thor in the temple. The wizard shows off his suspended cloak and tells Thor that he feels the" great change "of Thor's future."
"There are not many new scenes in the trailer of the latest" teca whitetti "movie, but we do see the arrival of" strange doctor. "
"So, Benedict Cumberbatch's doctor will drop in on Raytheon: ragnaro, which makes sense."
"If you stay after Doctor Strange last year (of course you do), you'll see the nominal wizard supreme and Chris Hemsworth's Thor sit down while drinking beer."

“Read Curtis’ full op-ed here.”
““Such behavior is unacceptable and entirely at odds with the the standards of conduct we demand of ourselves,” WPA president Richard Caleel said in a statement.”
“In the op-ed for the Huffington Post, published on Sunday, Curtis revealed that Dushku told her about the alleged incident years ago.”
““I was shocked and saddened then and still am today.”“Eliza’s story has now awakened us from our denial slumber to a new, horrific reality,” she wrote.”
““The abuse of children.”Curtis pointed to the complexities of working with child actors on set, and recalled when, while she was shooting 1991’s “My Girl” with a young Macaulay Culkin and Anna Chlumsky, she implemented a “swear jar” on set.”
““It is a complicated relationship working with children as they are being asked to do adult work with you in an adult field, surrounded by hundreds of adults who want them to perform for them, and yet are still inherently children,” Curtis said.”
““I have wrestled with my role as a mentor, colleague, surrogate, and friend, and each relationship is individual and unique.”
“Are we really friends?”
“Are we work mates?”
“Children are not mature enough to recognize that subtle difference.”But another disturbing aspect, Curtis wrote, revolved around the fact that the alleged assault was carried out by a stunt coordinator — the person on set who’s responsible for the actors’ safety.”


"Read Curtis's full review."
"Such conduct is unacceptable and totally inconsistent with the standards of conduct we are demanding," WPA chairman Richard Carlyle said in a statement
In a review of the Huffington Post published on Sunday, Curtis revealed that Dushku told her about the so-called incident a few years ago
"I was shocked and sad then, and I still am today." "Eliza's story now awakens us from a deep sleep of denial and brings us to face a new, terrifying reality," she wrote
"Child abuse." Curtis pointed out the complexity of working with children's actors on set and recalled that when she filmed "my girl" in 1991 with a young Macaulay kalkin and Anna krumsky, she implemented a "swear can" on set
"Working with children is a complex relationship because they are required to work with you in the adult field, and there are hundreds of adults around who want them to perform for them, but they are born children," Curtis said
"I've been trying to play the role of mentor, colleague, surrogate mother and friend, and every relationship is unique."
"Are we really friends?"
"Are we colleagues?"
"Children are not mature enough to realize this subtle difference," Curtis wrote But another disturbing aspect is that the so-called attacks were carried out by the stunt coordinator - the person in charge of the safety of the actors on the set

“Ahead, the leopard-print coats and plaid pants The Zoe Report is eyeing right now.”
“As any fashion-conscious person will agree, nothing is better than a piece that works double duty in your closet.”
“The pieces the trend requires can be paired together for a stylish statement or worn on their own for a more subdued look.”
“Pierre Suu/GC ImagesThe two best parts about this Roberts-inspired trend are the endless amount of options that come with it, as well as how easy it is to recreate within your own wardrobe.”
“This time around, Roberts made the ultimate statement by combing her love for leopard with perfectly tailored, plaid trousers.”
“The actor was also photographed in early August wearing the perfect cheetah-print shirt dress.”
“The American Horror Story veteran is no stranger to animal print, as Roberts spent much of last winter in an oversized leopard-print coat, which she paired with cut-off jeans and a white t-shirt.”
“Roberts completed the fall look with a long-line, leopard-print coat that she delicately draped over her shoulders and a pair of understated white boots.”
“The 27-year-old actor was photographed leaving her hotel in New York City wearing relaxed, plaid pants with a long-sleeve black-turtleneck sweater.”
“Although the concept of mixing prints was once considered a major fashion foul, Roberts proves that these days, it's more than OK.”


"Up front, Zoe's report is focusing on Leopard coats and plaid pants."
"Any fashion conscious person would agree that there's nothing better than having a double effect garment in your closet."
"The pieces needed by the trend can be matched together to show the fashion temperament, or you can wear them yourself to create a softer look."
"There are two great things about Pierre Suu / GC images, a trend designed by Roberts. One is that it brings endless choices, and the other is how easy it is to reproduce in your own wardrobe."
"This time, Roberts combined her love for leopards with her perfectly tailored plaid pants to make the ultimate statement."
"The actor was also photographed wearing the perfect cheetah print shirt and skirt in early August."
"The American horror story veteran is no stranger to animal prints, because Roberts spent most of last winter wearing an oversized leopard print jacket that she paired with tailored jeans and a white T-shirt."
"Roberts finished the autumn dress with a long Leopard Coat and a pair of low-key white boots, which were skillfully draped over his shoulders."
The 27 year old actor was photographed leaving a New York Hotel in baggy plaid pants and a long sleeve black turtleneck
"While the concept of hybrid printing was once considered a major fashion foul, Roberts proved these days that it's very good."

“While all five names nominated this time around have contributed to popular culture and proven themselves to be incredibly talented individuals, Cara’s win is deserved, and it’s difficult to argue against the Academy’s decision, difficult as it must have been to make.”
“That controversy was seemingly never addressed by the Academy, though there may be some questions now that she has not only been nominated, but has taken the gold.”
“Since her debut album (the one that made her well-known to the public) was released in November 2015, she should have been eligible for Best New Artist at the 2017 Grammys, where she wasn’t nominated for anything.”
“While she is clearly one of the most talented and promising young musicians out there, it is odd that Cara was nominated at all, given the tight restrictions that govern what year artists can be up for this trophy.”
“...collaboration Stay also broke into the region...”
“Not long after that song performed well her debut full length Know It All was released and it managed to start inside the top 10 in the U S She went on to send another single from the record Scars To Your Beautiful to the top 10 and her Zedd...”
“5 peak in America.”
“She first broke into the mainstream with her debut single “Here,” which took its time reaching its No.”
“Coming into tonight, the singer was up for four prizes in her first year at the Grammys—Best New Artist, Song of the Year, Best Short Form Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.”
“She beat out SZA, Julia Michaels, Khalid and Lil Uzi Vert for the honor.”


"Although the five names nominated this time have made contributions to popular culture and proved that they are incredible talents, Carla's victory is well deserved and it is difficult to refute the decision of the Academy, although it is certainly difficult to make such a decision."
"It seems that this dispute has never been resolved by the college, but there may be some problems now, because she not only won the nomination, but also won the gold medal."
"Since her debut album (the one she's known for) was released in November 2015, she should have qualified for the 2017 Grammy Best Newcomer Award, but she hasn't received any nominations."
"Although she is obviously one of the most talented and promising young musicians, considering the strict restrictions on the year in which artists can win the trophy, it's strange that Carla is nominated."
“… Cooperation has also intruded into this area... "
"Shortly after that song performed well, her debut" know it all "was released, and it successfully entered the top 10 in the United States. She then released a single, from the album" Scar "to" your beauty "to" top 10 "and her" Zedd "...."
"There are five mountains in America."

"Tonight, the singer won four awards in her first year's Grammy for best newcomer, song of the year, short format music video and popular duet / group performance."
"She beat Sasha, Julia Michaels, Khalid and Lille Utz Witt to win the honor."

“Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the matter.”
“In terms of the now-dimmed fraud lawsuit that started all this back in early 2017, representatives for TMG contacted by Deadline had no comment on the outcome of the Saturday and Sunday sit-down.”
“After a long weekend in which attorneys for both Depp and the Management Group went hard, the parries reached a confidential settlement, I hear.”
“While no one is talking, both sides in what has been a sometimes bitter and revelatory legal knife fight are happy with the deal, Deadline has learned.”
“Prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one the managed mediation between Depp s lawyer and TMG s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump Aldisert LLP comes after the actor s primary attorney Ben Chew of Washington D C s Brown Rudick failed late last month...”
“...to get the August 15 starting trial pushed back...”
“It’s rare for a plaintiff to seek a delay in a trial that they requested, and the unusual hearing came on the heels of a long Rolling Stone profile of the Depp that pretty much everyone agrees was not a winner for the actor.”
“Another factor in the agreement hammered out over talks on Saturday and Sunday was Depp finally sitting down for a frequently postponed deposition in the matter back in May in L.A.Now, with the deal sealed, all that’s old news and all that is left is the formalities.”
“Which means, if things go as they usually do in these things, that in the next couple of weeks, dismissal filings are likely to pop up in L.A. Superior Court dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed.”
“The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said that made to him will also be closed.”


"Depp's representative did not respond to a request for comment on the matter."
"In the case of fraud litigation that began in early 2017, TMG representatives contacted before the deadline did not comment on the outcome of the negotiations on Saturday and Sunday."
"I heard that after a long weekend, Depp and the management lawyers worked hard and the parries reached a confidentiality agreement."
"Although no one is talking, both sides are happy with the deal, which is sometimes a painful and enlightening legal battle."
"Driven by a judge in Los Angeles and supervised by a retired judge, Depp's lawyer and TMG representative of Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump Aldisert LLP conducted a managed mediation, after Brown Rudick of Washington, D.C Rudick's lead lawyer Ben chew failed at the end of last month. "
“… In order to postpone the trial that started on August 15... "
"It's very rare for the plaintiff to ask for a postponement of the trial. This unusual trial was conducted after Depp's long speech on rolling stone, and almost everyone agreed that he was not the winner."
"Another factor in the agreement that was finalized in the negotiations on Saturday and Sunday was that Depp finally sat down and prepared to take a frequently delayed oath in Los Angeles in May. Now, with the agreement, all this is old news, and all that's left is formalities. "
"This means that if things go on as usual, in the next few weeks, the Los Angeles High Court is likely to suddenly file a dismissal application, withdraw Depp's preliminary lawsuit in January 2017, and the committee will soon file a cross appeal."
"In November 2017, TMG's judicial foreclosure lawsuit against the actor's several Angel City Properties in connection with the $5 million loan provided to the actor will also end."

“The first day of fall classes at Harvard is August 30, 2017.”
“As solar eclipse selfies flooded social media timelines and cable news streamed continuous coverage, the former first family took the opportunity to move Malia Obama into her freshman dorm at Harvard University — out of the spotlight — on Monday.”
“In a video posted on Facebook, the 19-year-old is seen on campus with former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama by her side.”
“Other video shows the president and the first lady wearing dark sunglasses walking out of what some say was Malia's dorm and getting into a SUV as a crowd of onlookers cheer.”
“Malia Obama smiles as she boards Air Force One before departing from Andrews Air Force Base on April 7, 2016 in Maryland.”
“Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images fileUnlike the pandemonium that occurred at Stanford University when Chelsea Clinton arrived with Secret Service agents and over a hundred reporters on the day of freshman move-in, the scene at Harvard was less chaotic.”
“With so many people preoccupied with the solar eclipse and the official freshman move-in day taking place Tuesday, the Obamas’ presence on campus drew less attention.”
“In a photo posted online by the Daily Mail, Malia is seen outside the dorm the next day wearing a black outfit and white sneakers holding a bottle of water while chatting with what appears to be a group of students.”
“Related: Malia Obama to Attend Harvard UniversityJust like the Bush daughters attended the former colleges of their parents — Jenna, the University of Texas at Austin like their mother and Barbara, Yale University like their father — Malia is also keeping a college tradition in the family.”

"Different from the chaos at Stanford University, the scene at Harvard was not so chaotic when the freshman came here with secret service agents and more than 100 reporters on the day of admission."
"Because so many people are watching the eclipse, and Tuesday is Freshmen's day, the Obamas' presence on campus has attracted less attention."
"In a photo posted online by the daily mail, Maria was seen the next day in a black suit and white sneakers, holding a bottle of water, chatting with what appeared to be a group of students outside the dormitory."
"Related report: Maria Obama is going to Harvard University just like Bush's daughters went to their parents' previous University - Jenna, the University of Texas at Austin is like their mother and Barbara, Yale is like their father - Maria also keeps the university tradition at home."

“So, for now, you’d be wise to take this first trailer for “The Last Jedi” with a grain of salt.”
“Until the movie comes out we can’t know for sure.”
“The style on display is really striking, as is the new balanced philosophy of the Force it seems to be presenting.”
“But instead of getting overly excited about what we saw today, we should take a step back and remember that “Star Wars” marketing is hardly trustworthy these days.”
“Personally, I’m more wary of “Star Wars” marketing now than I’ve ever been before — and that’s saying something after the disastrous prequel era.”
“My skepticism is certainly warranted.”
“Marketing for the prequels wasn’t full of scenes that weren’t in those movies.”
“The trailers for “The Force Awakens” and “Rogue One,” on the other hand, very much were.”
“Also Read: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi': Let's See What We Can Learn from These 25 Trailer Shots (Photos)While “The Force Awakens” set off warning bells for the absence of seemingly significant trailer dialogue and scenes here and there, “Rogue One” took that to another level completely.”
“We are, after all, talking about a movie which was still including scenes that were cut in TV spots through its release in theaters.”

"As far as I'm concerned, I'm more cautious about marketing star wars now than ever - which illustrates something after the disastrous prequel era."
"My suspicions are, of course, justified."
"Prequel marketing doesn't flood scenes that aren't in movies."
"On the other hand, the trailers for force awakening and rogue one are wonderful."
"You can also read: 'Star Wars: the last Jedi': let's see what we can learn from these 25 trailers (Photos), while 'force awakening' sets an alarm bell for places and places where there seems to be no major Trailer dialogue and scenes, and 'rogue one' takes this completely to another level."

“NBC’s Will & Grace return seems particularly likely to suffer a sharp ratings drop-off in the next few weeks now that viewers who just wanted to see what all the revival fuss about have their curiosity sated.”
“Ratings have fallen back to Earth since the show shifted to its regular Thursday slot, but even so, it’s still helped Fox to its best numbers on the night in over two years.”

“ABC’s The Good Doctor, with Freddie Highmore as a pediatric surgeon with autism, is shaping up as the new season’s first breakout hit, giving ABC its best numbers for a new drama since 2014’s launch of How to Get Away With Murder.”

“With the state of the union even more depressing (at least for the 55 percent of the country unhappy with President Trump), the Peacock’s family drama returned last week to record ratings.”
“The trend toward warm and fuzzy began last season with the unexpectedly huge success of NBC’s This Is Us, an unashamed tearjerker whose message of family unity and love was the perfect antidote to the nastiness of the 2016 presidential election.”

“Daniel Craig is still playing 007 for now, but James Bond 25, which is set to arrive in theaters next November, is said to be his last.”

“Nobody involved with the franchise, as far as we know, is actually looking at a female to play 007 in the future.”
“Nor is there any indication Theron has been specifically approached, but her name has been bandied about, largely thanks to her roles in movies like Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde.”
“Theron says she likes the idea of going against type, but she feels she's too old for the part.”
“Here's what she had to say about it.”

"As far as we know, no one is involved in the show. In fact, they are interested in a woman playing 007 in the future."
