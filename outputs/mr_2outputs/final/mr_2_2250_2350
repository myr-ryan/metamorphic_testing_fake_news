"Both women were critical of the actor’s decision to wear a badge supporting the Time’s Up movement at the ceremony."
"Franco was later forced to deny the rumours during an interview with The Late Show host Stephen Colbert, describing the claims as “not accurate”."

“You can watch the full clip of Elba getting his karaoke jams on up top.”
“But get you a man who can do both, as the kids say these days.”
“I don’t think you'll be seeing much of this side of Elba when The Dark Tower drops on Friday, Aug. 4—his character is a certified badass in that movie.”
“Elba even decided to ad-lib at the end after the lyrics stopped flowing, improvising and telling the crowd how much he loves them.”
“The better performance, however, comes at the end of the clip, when Elba and Fallon bust out a duet version of Boyz II Men's "I'll Make Love To You," which is just as amazing as it sounds.”
“This is just a guess, but you should do yourself a favor and not ever refer to the love of your life's backside as a large sapling.”
“The first song, Sir Mix-a-Lot’s "Baby Got Back," was hilariously incoherent, with the big butt talk from the original song being converted to "large saplings."”
“But there was an important twist: the songs were first run through Google Translate, from English to another language then back to English, warping the original version of the tunes until they were almost unrecognizable.”
“To help promote his latest venture, a starring role in the film adaptation of Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, Elba sat alongside Fallon and ran through a couple of songs, karaoke style.”
“During an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Elba showed off some of the charisma that has made him a fixture in big-budget movies over the last half decade or so.”

"But get you a man who can do both, as the kids say these days."
"I don't do n’t think you 'll be seeing much of this side of Elba when The Dark Tower drops on Friday, Aug. 4 — his character is a certified badass in that movie."
"Elba did't even decide to ad- lib at the end after the lyrics stopped flowing, improvising and telling the crowd how much he loves them."
"The better performance, however, comes at the end of the clip, when Elba and Fallon bust out a duet version of Boyz II Men's "I'll Make Love To You," which is just as amazing as it sounds."
"This is just a guess, but you should do yourself a favor and not ever refer to the love of your life's backside as a large sapling."
"The first song, Sir Mix-a-Lot’s "Baby Got Back," was hilariously incoherent, with the big butt talk from the original song being converted to "large saplings.""
"But there was an important twist: the songs were first run through Google Translate, from English to another language then back to English, warping the original version of the tunes until they were almost unrecognizable."
"To help promote his latest venture, a starring role in the film adaptation of Stephen King’s The Dark Tower, Elba sat alongside Fallon and ran through a couple of songs, karaoke style."
"During an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Elba did't show off some of the charisma that has made him a fixture in big- budget movies over the last half decade or so."
