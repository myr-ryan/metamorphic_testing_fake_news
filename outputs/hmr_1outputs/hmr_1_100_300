Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh.
CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night.
And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes.
Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.
It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report.
After that, it spread fast.
Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose.
Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.

“According to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030.”

So, Washington will continue to “buy now,” while taxpayers 10, 20, and 30 years from now will be forced to “pay later.” And pay dearly, they will.
And in our current Fiscal Year, that falls on April 26 – this Sunday, just days before the Administration’s 100th day milestone.
The first three-plus months of this Administration have been turbulent, to say the least.
Confronted with the most severe economic crisis in generations, President Obama and congressional Democrats have set out on a spending spree the likes of which our nation has never seen.
In fact, the Administration has spent more in its first 100 days than all previous presidents have combined – hardly a distinction of which to be proud.
Feeling the heat, the President has asked his Cabinet to begin identifying wasteful programs to cut from the federal budget.
While this sort of talk sounds good, the inescapable fact is that the Administration and Congress have spent the last three months piling mountains of wasteful debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren.
Just take a look at how some of the so-called “stimulus” dollars are being spent.
In spite of promises of transparency and accountability from the Administration hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars are being spent on wasteful projects a skateboard park in Rhode Island bike racks in the District of Columbia highway studies instead of construction projects in my native Ohio and programs led by...
...housing agencies that have repeatedly failed audits all in the name of economic stimulus This Sunday marks a day that is symbolic not only of our government s arrogant culture of spending but of this Administration s borrowing binge as well...

“"Space debris is a huge problem," says Laura Grego, staff scientist in the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.”
“INTERNATIONAL THREATFor many countries, the most disturbing aspect of the test was not the potentially destabilizing sat kill, but the resulting debris, which poses a serious threat to every satellite in orbit, as well as to the International Space Station.”
“And some Israeli officials have argued that, given China's record of selling missile technology to Iran, Israel should develop its own program.”
“In fact, after the Chinese test, India publicly stepped up its development of antiÂ­satellite technology.”
“You don't just go and blow things up there."”
“If we're not careful, space could become the new Wild West.”
“"The move was a dangerous step toward the abyss of weaponizing space," says Theresa Hitchens, director of the Center for Defense Information, an independent defense research group in Washington, D.C. "China held the moral high ground about space, and that test re-energized the China hawks in Congress.”
“But as a demonstration of a rising military posture, it was a surprisingly aggressive act, especially since China has long pushed for an international treaty banning space weapons.”

“Theres no way to quantify that, but its not out of the realm of possibility.”
“Its worth considering that the Supermax model--which includes prisoner isolation for 23 out of every 24 hours a day--may be serving as a deterrent to some violent criminals, a kind of brightly lit billboard that advertises the life of rather extreme measures they are facing.”
“Most of the Supermaxes in the United States, such as the federal facility in Florence, are brand new or nearly so.”
“In 1998, approximately 20,000 inmates were locked up in this type of prison, representing less than 2% of all the men and women currently incarcerated across the country.”
“Only a fraction of these populations find themselves in a Supermax facility.”
“About 2.1 million are behind bars, while another 4.9 million are on probation, parole or some other type of community correction.”
“In the United States alone, some 7 million people are under the control of the criminal justice system.”
“The Supermaxes maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Marion, Ill., and Florence, Colo., incarcerate a total of 1,710 people, including such notable criminals as "Unabomber" Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols.”
“Originally set up to house the most violent, hardened and escape-prone criminals, Supermaxes are instead used for leaders of criminal organizations and gangs, serial killers, persistent rule-breakers and political criminals like spies and terrorists.”
“However, as good as these prisons are at keeping our worst offenders in check, the purpose of the Supermax is in flux.”

“In addition, the FDIC anticipates using a mystery shopper program in conjunction with its examination process of institutions involved in payday lending.”
“FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending have been instructed to submit plans detailing how they will address the revised guidance.”
“Other key provisions of the July 2003 guidance remain unchanged.”
“In any event, whether or not an institution is able to provide a customer alternative credit products, an extension of a payday loan is not appropriate under such circumstances.”
“When a customer has used payday loans more than three months in the past 12 months, institutions should offer the customer, or refer the customer to, an alternative longer-term credit product that more appropriately suits the customer's needs.”
“To reduce these risks and promote responsible lending, the revised guidance states that institutions should ensure that payday loans are not provided to customers who have had payday loans outstanding from any lender for a total of three months in the previous 12- month period.”
“The FDIC believes that providing high-cost, short-term credit on a recurring basis to customers with long-term credit needs is not responsible lending; increases institutions' credit, legal, reputational, and compliance risks; and can create a serious financial hardship for the customer.”
“The FDIC's concerns about payday lending have been heightened as it has observed payday lending conducted in a manner that is inconsistent with the July 2003 guidance and inconsistent with prudent lending practices.”
“The FDIC initially issued guidance on payday lending in July 2003 because payday lending is a high-risk activity that presents significant safety and soundness and consumer protection concerns.”
“When used frequently or for long periods, the total costs can rapidly exceed the amount borrowed.”


In addition, the FDIC anticipates using a mystery shopper program in conjunction with its examination process of institutions involved in payday lending.
FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending have been instructed to submit plans detailing how they will address the revised guidance.
Other key provisions of the July 2003 guidance remain unchanged.
In any event, whether or not an institution is able to provide a customer alternative credit products, an extension of a payday loan is not appropriate under such circumstances.
When a customer has used payday loans more than three months in the past 12 months, institutions should offer the customer, or refer the customer to, an alternative longer-term credit product that more appropriately suits the customer's needs.
To reduce these risks and promote responsible lending, the revised guidance states that institutions should ensure that payday loans are not provided to customers who have had payday loans outstanding from any lender for a total of three months in the previous 12- month period.
The FDIC believes that providing high-cost, short-term credit on a recurring basis to customers with long-term credit needs is not responsible lending; increases institutions' credit, legal, reputational, and compliance risks; and can create a serious financial hardship for the customer.

“The searchable table shows both party unity and presidential support scores over the entire Bush presidency for individual lawmakers who are currently serving in the 110th Congress.”
“It underscores the high level of Capitol Hill partisanship that has been a hallmark of the period, and shows that while Republican support for President Bush was quite high, Democratic support was almost nonexistent in the House and very limited in the Senate.”
“It is a first-ever look at the way lawmakers voted over an entire presidency.”
“Partisanship and Presidential Support in the Bush EraCQ has completed a study of all roll-call votes during the seven-and-a-half years of President Bush's two terms — up to Congress' August recess.”

“I’ve got a different view.”
“Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we’ll be better off.”
“The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent – no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say.”
“Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.”
“The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices.”
“And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.”
“Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections.”
“There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.”
“Tonight’s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission.”
“This debate and the next three – two presidential, one vice presidential – are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.”
