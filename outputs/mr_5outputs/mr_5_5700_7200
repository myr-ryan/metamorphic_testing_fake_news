“We can be one thing one day and someone else the next.” Balmain, Saint Laurent, Alexandre Vauthier, and Marc Jacobs are on her style agenda for the season.”
“She’s really versatile and that’s a total reflection of the modern woman.”
“Everything both '80s and '90s is stylish again, and almost every beloved film or series from the past four decades has been rebooted and reworked for modern day.”
“So, it wasn’t a complete surprise that the CW wanted to take on one of the shadiest, most stylish dramas of all time: none other than Dynasty.”
“Since Gossip Girl ended almost five years ago, we haven’t truly had another soap opera-level, style-focused show to indulge in, thus the series’ revamp couldn’t have come at a better time.”
“And it’s absolutely kismet that the 2017 Dynasty has the Upper East Side-centric show’s creators, Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage at its design helm, as well as costume designer Eric Daman’s right hand, Meredith Markworth-Pollack working on the wardrobe.”
“Christopher Fragapane/The CW Network/Everett CollectionDynasty is indeed a series about the upper crust of the one percent, but the revamp has come a long way from some of the sexist and homophobic undertones present in the '80s run.”
“The 2017 version boasts a diverse, inclusive, and gorgeous cast, including Steven Carrington, who is openly gay and environmentally conscious; Cristal and Sammy Jo, both Venezuelan and proud of their heritage; and the Colbys, who are now played by black actors.”
“And though there is a catfight — bringing back one of the most infamous moments from the original show — this time, the squabble is happening because both Fallon Carrington and Cristal are vying for a leadership position at Carrington Atlantic.”
“The show is steeped in female empowerment and gives us a taste of how powerful women are dressing in the office in 2017.”

“No one stands up to powerful men.’”A second allegation of sexual harassment was made against Hoffman by producer Wendy Riss Gatsiounis who alleges that, as a playwright in 1991, a meeting with the actor and Tootsie screenwriter Murray Schisgal turned unprofessional following inappropriate remarks.”
““It is reflective of who you were.”
“The Last Week Tonight host and actor entered a heated debate during a Tribeca Institute 20th anniversary panel and screening of 1997 film Wag the Dog, during which Hoffman vehemently defended his behaviour and accused Oliver of “making a very quick judgement”.”
“Oliver has now opened up about the incident, revealing that he believed, “the first person that he talked to (publicly) was going to have to ask him questions about it.”
“Unfortunately, that was me.” He said that the discussion continued for so long because he thought Hoffman’s answers “were pretty bad”.”
““I wanted to try and get him to a point of self-reflection and to try and get something out of the conversation, but that didn’t happen,” he added.”
“During the panel Oliver first breached the subject by stating This is something we re going to have to talk about because it s hanging in the air The host was referencing allegations that he sexually harassed Anna Graham Hunter as a 17 year old production assistant on the set...”
“...of his 1985 TV film Death of a Salesman...”
“Audience members – including The Washington Post journalist Steve Zeitchik – were said to be “visibly shocked” by the interaction, in which Oliver expressed disappointment in Hoffman’s original apology in which he claimed the behaviour is not reflective of who he is.”
““It’s that part of the response to this stuff that pisses me off,” Oliver stated.”

“Viewers have been particularly invested in Kufrin's happily ever after ever since she was subjected to the on-camera breakup, and on Tuesday, she revealed that she does in fact find love at the end of her journey, which wrapped filming weeks ago.”
“Because of how things ended, I think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn't change it."”
“On Wednesday, the pair said neither of them has watched the finale to this day.”
“Think pieces and takedowns ran in the week that followed and as Kufrin accepted her new role as the next star of The Bachelorette, Luyendyk and Burnham largely disappeared from the spotlight, choosing to keep viewers updated on their relationship via their social media channels.”
“The choices made by Luyendyk and producers to ambush Kufrin, and by ABC to air the breakup footage, sent backlash Luyendyk's way and turned off some fans of the franchise.”
“At the end of the day, it's a TV show but this is the rest of our lives, and Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with."”
“"Going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn't a popular decision," Luyendyk explained, "but it was a decision I had to make for myself.”
“He then turned around and proposed a second time on live television to Burnham, who accepted.”
“After a two-month engagement, Luyendyk called off his relationship with Kufrin during a difficult-to-watch on-camera breakup that played out unedited and ran for nearly an hour.”
“After he proposed to an accepting Becca Kufrin on the pretaped March 5 episode, it was revealed on the post-finale After the Final Rose special that Luyendyk had changed his mind.”

“The incident in question allegedly took place last year, after his show at the Cliffs Pavilion in Essex.”
“The woman accusing Nelly of misconduct claims she asked him to take a photo following his 5 December performance.”
“She says the rapper gripped her tightly with his arm and brought her and her friends to his dressing room.”

“An argument, by the way, generally made by heterosexuals who have no idea of how often they assert their own sexuality on a daily basis in the pictures on their desks, the conversations they have about their spouses or their children, and the way they interact.”
“As her anniversary approaches, there is some danger in overstating the impact of DeGeneres’ dual public announcement: literally on an April 14, 1997 Time cover emblazoned with the words “Yep, I’m Gay,” and figuratively two weeks later, in the April 30, 1997 "Puppy Episode" of her ABC sitcom Ellen.”
“Culture and history seldom pivot on one moment alone, and almost never do so on the back of a single TV episode — even one watched by 36 million people.”
“Yet despite those caveats, there’s little doubt that DeGeneres’ decision to publicly embrace her homosexuality — and, with ABC’s reluctant but eventual cooperation, to extend that embrace to her fictional character — was a watershed in how gay men and women are treated on TV.”
“And over time, the lessons we learn from TV seep into real life.”
“Granted, Ellen Morgan was not the first gay character to enter our homes through our TV sets.”
“Viewers had already seen Billy Crystal's star-making performance in the 1977 sitcom Soap as the long-suffering Jodie Dallas, though he had more on-air relationships with women than with men.”
“And more than a year before Ellen’s coming-out declaration, NBC's Friends had aired "The One with the Lesbian Wedding" of Susan and Carol — transforming a couple who had initially served as a reflected joke on Ross into people in their own right.”
“Still for the most part gay men and women were as invisible on TV as they were in movies making occasional appearances as characters whose tragic disgrace was linked to a hinted at love that dare not speak its name The most you d find were asexual camp twists on...”

“In a recent interview with Grazia Craig spoke about how the past few months have influenced Chapman’s work, but emphasized that she has been strong and doesn’t think of herself as a victim.”
““Everything you see here today Georgina sketched while she was out of the office and going through a very, very tough time,” Craig said of Marchesa’s Fall/Winter 2018 collection.”

“Back in March, Rose expressed her wish to work through whatever relationship issues they were having.”
“That's a point she made loud and clear when she uploaded a heartfelt post to Instagram Monday afternoon (May 14).”
“Addressing the idea that she's a "gold digger" or someone simply after rich men, Rose expressed her love for 21 while explaining all that she thinks makes him awesome.”
“"I Love this man so much," she begins in the post.”
““I know the Internet portrays me to be some heartless person or they feel like I’m incapable of love but I love him so hard.”
“He is not only one of the most talented people I have ever met but he is so real, humble and smart as hell."”
“In the last half of the caption, which is for an image of herself and 21, Rose issues a message to those who'd like to make assumptions about her relationship status based on who she pops up in pictures with.”
“This bit could be referencing a pic she posted of herself and Lil Pump hanging out at the 2018 Rolling Loud Festival on Sunday (May 13).”
“A short while later, one Insta user made a comment possibly insinuating that Rose was involved with the Miami rapper and Rose promptly had him blocked.”

“CNN announced the last season of the travel show will premiere on Sept. 23, and will include five episodes of Bourdain’s travels to Kenya, Indonesia, West Texas, Spain and New York City’s Lower East Side, plus two additional episodes to honor the host.”
“Only the first episodes will include Bourdain's narration, as the rest had not been completed before his death.”
“The celebrity chef and food journalist was posthumously honored with Emmys for outstanding writing for a nonfiction program and outstanding informational series or special.”
““We wish we were there to shoot it with him, and he really would have written the hell out of that episode."”
“"He’s really off on a journey to parts unknown," Tengalia added in her speech.”
“His body was discovered by close friend and fellow chef, Éric Ripert, with whom he had been traveling for “Parts Unknown.” His cause of death was ruled a suicide.”
“"Tony was nominated for this Emmy many times, but it had always eluded him, the one he had always coveted, so it is with tremendous bittersweetness that I accept it on his behalf," Bourdain's producer, Lydia Tenaglia, said onstage as she clutched the writing trophy.”

“And while the audience was apparently shocked by this statement, he's not wrong.”

“Cudlitz again, mocking the terribleness of this scene which, if Rick had simply shot Negan when he first swaggered out the door, would have put a blessed end to this whole nonsensical plot:“He’s right there!”
“Apparently at this point the actor started "miming stray firing before imitating the showy Savior leader."”

“1, it would have set an all-time record for most weeks at the top of the chart.”

“Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the matter.”
“In terms of the now-dimmed fraud lawsuit that started all this back in early 2017, representatives for TMG contacted by Deadline had no comment on the outcome of the Saturday and Sunday sit-down.”
“After a long weekend in which attorneys for both Depp and the Management Group went hard, the parries reached a confidential settlement, I hear.”
“While no one is talking, both sides in what has been a sometimes bitter and revelatory legal knife fight are happy with the deal, Deadline has learned.”
“Prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one the managed mediation between Depp s lawyer and TMG s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump Aldisert LLP comes after the actor s primary attorney Ben Chew of Washington D C s Brown Rudick failed late last month...”
“...to get the August 15 starting trial pushed back...”
“It’s rare for a plaintiff to seek a delay in a trial that they requested, and the unusual hearing came on the heels of a long Rolling Stone profile of the Depp that pretty much everyone agrees was not a winner for the actor.”
“Another factor in the agreement hammered out over talks on Saturday and Sunday was Depp finally sitting down for a frequently postponed deposition in the matter back in May in L.A.Now, with the deal sealed, all that’s old news and all that is left is the formalities.”
“Which means, if things go as they usually do in these things, that in the next couple of weeks, dismissal filings are likely to pop up in L.A. Superior Court dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed.”
“The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said that made to him will also be closed.”

“But one actress, Allen’s Oscar-winning Blue Jasmine leading lady Cate Blanchett, isn’t quite as ready to step away.”
“In a new interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Blanchett said that social media—the birthplace of these hashtag social-justice movements—is “not the judge and jury” when it comes to Allen.”
“In the wake of the Time’s Up movement, Dylan Farrow has been emboldened to share her story more publicly and more often, prompting journalists such as Amanpour to press former- and current-Allen collaborators for their take on the director.”
“Amanpour questioned Blanchett, saying: “How do you juxtapose being a #MeToo proponent, a Time’s Up proponent, and staying silent or having worked with Woody Allen?” She also asked if Blanchett would work with Allen again, given the allegations.”
“The actress responded:I don’t think I’ve stayed silent at all.”

“We know this because Shakira snapped a video of her stylist extraordinaire showing off a peak into their pre-show ritual.”
“But with all of the curls and clips, sometimes things fall through the cracks.”

“Getty ImagesThe publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.”
“Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts.”
“Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.”
“Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.”
“A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch.”

“And arguably the buzziest one of them all is the Jordan Peele-led reboot of the classic science fiction series “The Twilight Zone.”So how did CBS All Access, a small but growing player in the high-stakes streaming wars, land the Oscar-winning writer and director of “Get Out”?”
““We actually had heard that Jordan was such a fan of the original series that he credits it to some extent with his interest in becoming an artist,” Julie McNamara, executive VP, original content, CBS All Access, told TheWrap.”
““Having heard that, we pursued a conversation with him to see if that’s something he would be interested in.”It won’t be the first, or even second time the series has been rebooted.”
“There have been two prior revivals of the classic series.”
“The first aired for 110 episodes on CBS in 1985, and a second version, with Forest Whitaker in Rod Serling’s famous role, ran for 43 episodes on UPN in the early 2000s.”

““It happens to coincide with a moment in the culture that feels specifically ripe for this show to come back,” she said, likening “Get Out” to a two-hour episode that would feel right at home in Serling’s original version.”

“So when the Season 6 finale came and went last month, everyone assumed the comedy was getting one more chapter for a proper sendoff.”
“But as broadcast series renewals and cancellations started rolling in midway through last week, a shocker hit the rumor mill — New Girl was getting canceled.”
“While the show did not officially get the ax, it came very, very close to it.”
“I hear that was because of various reasons (for instance, star Zooey Deschanel is on maternity leave having just given birth to her second child), most if not all main cast members would not be able to return to work until the fall.”
“With the logistical challenges, no space on the midseason schedule and a Season 6 finale that tied in a bow so many loose ends, the network leaned heavily toward not going with a seventh season.”

“"I support these women as we seek out and demand accountability from the only ones responsible for assault and rape: the people who perpetrate these heinous crimes."”
“Mayim Bialik has come under fire from several of her Hollywood peers after the Big Bang Theory actress wrote an op-ed column titled "Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein's World," for the New York Times.”
“In the piece published on Friday, Bialik, 41, describes coming of age as a "prominent-nosed, awkward, geeky, Jewish 11-year-old," and being aware that she was different from her onscreen contemporaries of the late '80s, who she says were praised for their curves.”
“"I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry that profits on the objectification of women," she writes, adding that from an early age she made "wise" personal choices in order to protect herself, including dressing "modestly" and not acting "flirtatiously" with men.”
“"I am entirely aware that these types of choices might feel oppressive to many young feminists," she added.”
“"Women should be able to wear whatever they want.”
“They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want."”

“And yet war has done things to them that make their reunion just as emotional as if they had been best friends, and perspective that helps them look back on the kids they were and wonder how things might have been different.”
“But Jon and Sansa were not close: he was sullen and removed, she was judgmental, and they never really bonded.”
“Those questions are not necessarily a problem—it gives the show a point of dramatic interest, provided that their return explains the missing time and reactivates our interest in the character.”
“Accordingly, however, it becomes less viable for the show to ignore a character for extended periods without the audience starting to ask questions.”
“Although episodes like “Blackwater,” “The Watchers On The Wall,” and “Hardhome”—among others—have replicated this tight focus on a single scenario, most episodes jump between stories often, rarely creating the same sense of immersion.”
“By comparison, though, the show can’t necessarily do the same.”
“The singular focus of the chapters is incredibly immersive, reconnecting you to a location, a set of characters, and a situation, and then spending a decent amount of time there.”
“While I would sometimes get impatient if I went too long between certain characters’ chapters—although this was not the case with those ADWD Bran chapters—I didn’t find myself spending each chapter wondering what those characters were up to.”
“AdvertisementReading the books, though, I got used to these absences.”
“And so while we could focus on Bran’s absence from A Feast For Crows—mirrored by his absence in season five—we could also focus on his absence for a 21-chapter stretch in A Dance With Dragons.”

“News, Bullock has donated more than $5 million to charities and people in need over the years, including $1 million to 9/11 relief efforts, $1 million to help victims of the tsunami in Indonesia in 2004, and another $1 million to the Red Cross after Hurricane Katrina.”
“As noted by E!”
“As it turns out, though, this is far from the first time that Bullock has used her superstar status to help people in need.”
““There are no politics in eight feet of water,” she says, “there are human beings in eight feet of water.” (Bullock presumably missed Donald Trump’s hurricane response, because he seems pretty confident that there’s a ton of politics in eight feet of water.)”
“That’s according to People, which says that Bullock released a brief statement saying that she hopes we can rise above the current political climate and join together to help those in need.”
“(Photo: Getty Images/Film Magic, Jon Kopaloff)A lot of people and organizations have been chipping in to help the Hurricane Harvey relief efforts in Texas, and one particularly charitable famous person is Sandra Bullock, who recently donated $1 million to the American Red Cross.”

“The video also teases “Taymojis,” another feature strangely reminiscent of a certain reality TV star’s “Kimojis.” The two may be enemies engaged in a battle over “receipts,” but apparently that hasn’t stopped Swift from taking ample inspiration from Kardashian’s business playbook.”
““Get exclusive pics and video!” In addition to access to Taylor, the app will provide opportunities for Swift fans to connect and network with each other, building on Swift’s already-strong presence on platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram.”
““Connect with Taylor!” the video promises.”
“It seems to borrow from the other Kim Kardashian app, the one that isn’t from Glu, the Kim Kardashian West Official App, which offers “premium” content to paid subscribers.”
“According to a first-look video the company released, Swift’s app will be less game and more access.”
“The Swift Life comes from Glu Mobile, the same company responsible for games like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Nicki Minaj: The Empire.”
“The app store, which will see the debut of her proprietary app later this year, just in time to coincide with the publicity cycle for the artist’s new album, Reputation, slated for November.”
“The star’s next conquest?”
“Whether she’s sailing by on a UPS truck or loudly proclaiming herself unable to come to the phone because she’s dead, Taylor Swift is increasingly inescapable.”

“In the end, it was Team Big Brother that finished first, making Cody Nickson and Jessica Graf the winners of The Amazing Race Season 30.”
“Host Phil Keoghan wasn’t kidding when he warned that this would be the most challenging physical and mental challenge yet.”
“Following a cookie-making challenge — which was not as fun as it sounds — the teams had to run all over a military ship, collecting pieces to build a damn airplane that would land on the Official Amazing Race Winners’ Mat™.”
“And things only became more difficult when the final three teams traveled to San Francisco, where their kayaking and bridge-climbing skills were put to the test — not to mention their patience, as several players lost their cool and snapped at their well-meaning teammates.”
“(And if you think that was a bad race-car driving pun, you should check out The Bachelor sometime.)”
“Clues based on previous challenges led the teams to their final destination, with Team Yale arriving first, followed by Teams Big Brother and Extreme — which meant, sadly, Alex and Conor had to pump the brakes on their Amazing Race journey.”
“(Don’t get me wrong, I realize that other players had fun with this challenge, but Cody — with those wide eyes and that megawatt smile — just seemed to enjoy it a little too much.)”
“Then came Cody’s absolute favorite part of the finale: getting to smash a bunch of computers and hard drives to pieces with a baseball bat.”

“If Dean and Lesley make it, kudos to them!”
“In reality, Bachelor-formed couples do not typically have much staying power, and there is a lot of time left in the year.”
“The Bachelor franchise’s most successful couple, Trista and Ryan Sutter, will be kicking off the games as “grand marshals.” What that means is not entirely clear, but hopefully some of their good luck will rub off on the other contestants.”
“We’ll also see guest spots from former Bachelorettes Rachel Lindsay (especially spicy considering two of her former bachelors are a part of the Winter Games cast) and JoJo Fletcher, as well as current Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr.”
“World figure skating champions Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner are set to appear, as is former Tonya Harding nemesis Nancy Kerrigan.”
“There will also be numerous guest appearances.”
“Not all 24 cast members have been revealed yet, however, we do know there will be ten former US Bachelor contestants (including Unglert, Eric Bigger, Ben Higgins, and Ashley Iaconetti), and 14 international contestants (including Benoit Beausejour Savard from Canada and Jordan Mauger of New Zealand).”
“Now, we don’t know exactly what those “tests” are going to look like, but do not be surprised if it means seeing Dean Unglert shirtless on a ski hill.”
“Except this time, as a press release from ABC states, the competitions will test the contestants’ perseverance in pursuing relationships, as they will be faced with language barriers and cultural differences.”
“The ultimate goal for the contestants is the same as it has always been: to fall deeply and sincerely in love.”

“More Olympic world not better off after USOC s Scott Blackmun resigning Related American gymnasts detail sexual abuse to legislators on Capitol Hill Larry Nassar case Parents lash out You violated our daughters Moore s sister Kamerin also is a victim and spoke during her victim impact statement in January...”
“A male gymnast alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that he was sexually abused by Larry Nassar, becoming the first known male victim to file suit against the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State team doctor.”
“In one of six amended complaints filed in federal court Wednesday as part of a civil suit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State, Jacob Moore claims that he was sexually abused and harassed by Nassar in 2016.”
“According to the amended complaint, which was obtained by USA TODAY Sports on Thursday night, Moore alleges that he went to Nassar's home to receive treatment for a shoulder injury when he was 16 years old.”
“After a female gymnast, who was also a minor at the time, entered the basement where Nassar was treating Moore, the doctor pulled down Moore's pants and exposed him to the female, according to the complaint.”
“Nassar told Moore that he would treat the gymnast's shoulder injury "through acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia," then proceeded to do so.”
“"There is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male’s genitalia," the complaint states.”
“The amended complaint first was reported by International Gymnast Magazine.”
“Moore, who now is a gymnast at the University of Michigan, joins the more than 260 women and girls who have told law enforcement that they were sexually abused by Nassar.”

“Now it's been reported the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be staying at the Queen's Sandringham estate this Christmas - where they'll be "packed like sardines" among the monarch's nearest and dearest.”
