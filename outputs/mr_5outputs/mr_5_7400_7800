“The company was fined more than $25,000 for safety violations — including for providing inadequate equipment training for the mother-of-two — by the state of Nevada.”
“In 2013, Sarah Guyard-Guillot, who was also from France, fell almost 100 feet to her death when her safety net failed during a performance of “Ka” at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.”
“This is not the first time a member of the circus troupe — known for its death-defying stunts, which are performed largely without safety nets — has died on stage.”
“Arnaud worked various shows in several hotels before joining VOLTA’s cast full-time in 2016.”
“Arnaud described himself on social media as being trained in high-flying circus acts, including the “solo single ring spin” and “Swiss rings.”He had at least two daughters, including one born in August 2015 to wife and model Inna D Gorelova, according to his social media accounts.”
“VOLTA is based on extreme sports.”
““We are offering our full and transparent collaboration to the authorities as they look into the circumstances of this accident.’’Meanwhile, the show’s two final scheduled performances in the city have been canceled.”
““Yann had been with us for over 15 years and was loved by all who had the chance to know him,” said Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group President and CEO Daniel Lamarre in a statement.”
“The aerialist, originally from France, was rushed to Tampa General Hospital but died of his injuries, Cirque said.”

“But then of course there is a surge of tinted moisturizers that claim to hydrate the skin while simultaneously evening out your skin tone… Okay, now it really got confusing!”
“First, let’s figure out how they’re similar.”
“Both foundation and tinted moisturizers contain a solvent (water), mixtures of humectants (chemicals that bind water to your skin) and emollients (oily chemicals that smooth the skin and create a moisture barrier).”
“We all know from elementary school that oil and water don’t mix so they both contain surfactants to keep the water and oil-soluble ingredients mixed together in a creamy base.”
“Like most products on the shelf, they both have preservatives to keep them from spoiling – who wants to put moldy foundation or tinted moisturizer on – yuck!!”
