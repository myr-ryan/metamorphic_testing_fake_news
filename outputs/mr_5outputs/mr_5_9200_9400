““What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he said.”
“Despite this, he did not realize that the incidents were part of a larger pattern.”
“He also was aware that Rose McGowan, who last week tweeted that Weinstein had raped her, had allegedly reached a legal settlement with him.”
“I knew he did a couple of these things.”Tarantino owned up to hearing directly from his ex-girlfriend Mira Sirvino and another unnamed actres about their experiences with Weinstein.”
“It wasn’t secondhand.”
““There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip.”
““I knew enough to do more than I did,” Tarantino told the paper.”
“In the interview, the director, who worked with Weinstein on basically all his major film projects, said that he’d known about Weinstein’s action as far back as the ’90s but didn’t do anything to stop it, something he admits to regretting.”
“In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Tarantino admitted that he knew of Weinstein’s alleged mistreatment of women years ago but did not do enough to stop it.”


“In an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Tarantino admitted that he knew of Weinstein’s alleged mistreatment of women years ago but did not do enough to stop it.”
““I knew enough to do more than I did,” Tarantino told the paper.”
““Anything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.”Instead, Tarantino continued to work with Weinstein in the years since, including on Oscar-nominated films “Inglorious Basterds” and “Django Unchained.”A rep for Apatow declined a request for comment, while Tarantino’s did not respond.”
“Despite this, he did not realize that the incidents were part of a larger pattern.”
“In the interview, the director, who worked with Weinstein on basically all his major film projects, said that he’d known about Weinstein’s action as far back as the ’90s but didn’t do anything to stop it, something he admits to regretting.”
“I knew he did a couple of these things.”Tarantino owned up to hearing directly from his ex-girlfriend Mira Sirvino and another unnamed actres about their experiences with Weinstein.”
“It wasn’t secondhand.”
““There was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip.”
“He also was aware that Rose McGowan, who last week tweeted that Weinstein had raped her, had allegedly reached a legal settlement with him.”
““What I did was marginalize the incidents,” he said.”

“And just a week ago, Gossip Cop corrected a tabloid cover story that wrongly maintained Jennifer Lopez was pregnant with Rodriguez’s baby boy.”
“Gossip Cop recently busted a magazine report that falsely alleged Strahan was feuding with Robin Roberts at “GMA.“ As we noted, the reality is the two anchors get along great.”
“In addition to being athletes turned TV personalities, Strahan and Rodriguez have also both been the subject of a slew of inaccurate reports.”
“Regardless, from what Gossip Cop hears from a mutual pal and network sources, Strahan is pretty pumped about Rodriguez joining the ABC team.”
“So sadly, we won’t be surprised if there are fake news stories filled with made-up quotes from unnamed sources about how Strahan is supposedly upset by Rodriguez’s arrival or is battling the baseball player for scoops.”
“Generally, when one celebrity is announced to be joining another star, the gossip magazines start spinning reports about (untrue) drama behind-the-scenes.”
“Of course, Gossip Cop has been around long enough to know that unreliable blogs and disreputable tabloids will undoubtedly try to manufacture a phony feud between the two New York sports heroes.”
