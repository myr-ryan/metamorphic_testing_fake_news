“But soon after, Affleck more or less went public with his romance with Lindsay Shookus, a “Saturday Night Live” producer whom he may have started seeing when he was still married to Garner.”
“But three years after that initial 2015 announcement, Affleck and Garner, both 45, have yet to finalize their divorce, raising the question: What’s taking so long?”
“A new report by Us Weekly cites sources who say that the “Batman v. Superman” actor is dragging his feet because he would like to get back together with Garner, with whom he has three children.”
“If this description of Affleck is close to accurate, he could be the Oscar-winning, movie star version of “Bachelor” star Arie Luyendyk Jr., who angered Bachelor Nation and the rest of America by vacillating between two women in the show’s final episodes.”
“For her part, Garner really tried to make things work with Affleck — despite his reported struggles with alcohol addiction, gambling and monogamy, according to Us Weekly.”
“This fall, Affleck also had a dark cloud hanging over him following news about multiple sexual misconduct allegations against his regular producing collaborator Harvey Weinstein.”
“In the wake of the Weinstein allegations and the launch of the #MeToo movement, Affleck was accused of groping two women and of being complicit in a Hollywood culture that allows sexually predatory men to stay in power.”
“After Garner and Affleck first announced their split in 2015, the “Alias” actress “put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and wanted so desperately to turn things around for the children’s sake as well as theirs,” a source told Us Weekly.”

“Still, Affleck and Garner have continued to be seen in public together, attending church or taking the kids to school — though these joint appearances could simply be part of their vow to be hands-on co-parents.”
“But soon after, Affleck more or less went public with his romance with Lindsay Shookus, a “Saturday Night Live” producer whom he may have started seeing when he was still married to Garner.”
“But three years after that initial 2015 announcement, Affleck and Garner, both 45, have yet to finalize their divorce, raising the question: What’s taking so long?”
“A new report by Us Weekly cites sources who say that the “Batman v. Superman” actor is dragging his feet because he would like to get back together with Garner, with whom he has three children.”
“If this description of Affleck is close to accurate, he could be the Oscar-winning, movie star version of “Bachelor” star Arie Luyendyk Jr., who angered Bachelor Nation and the rest of America by vacillating between two women in the show’s final episodes.”
“For her part, Garner really tried to make things work with Affleck — despite his reported struggles with alcohol addiction, gambling and monogamy, according to Us Weekly.”
“This fall, Affleck also had a dark cloud hanging over him following news about multiple sexual misconduct allegations against his regular producing collaborator Harvey Weinstein.”
“In the wake of the Weinstein allegations and the launch of the #MeToo movement, Affleck was accused of groping two women and of being complicit in a Hollywood culture that allows sexually predatory men to stay in power.”
“After Garner and Affleck first announced their split in 2015, the “Alias” actress “put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and wanted so desperately to turn things around for the children’s sake as well as theirs,” a source told Us Weekly.”

“According to In Touch, Brad has become smitten with a 21-year-old British actress named Ella Purnell — who, interestingly enough, played a young Angelina in 2014’s Maleficent.”
“If that means he won’t see the kids as much or at the holidays, he has made peace with it.”This attitude adjustment could be a result of the 53-year-old’s new social life.”
““There have been rumors circulating for weeks that Brad has moved on with a new woman, but no one was ready to see him hand-in-hand with royalty from Monaco.”For more info on Brad’s holiday plans, pick up the current issue of Life & Style, on newsstands now!”
““Angie is using the kids as pawns against him,” an insider explains.”
“As Life & Style previously reported, Angelina was making it hard for Brad to see his six children — Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9 — over the holidays.”
““There are two choices for Brad,” the insider notes.”
““Brad knows he can’t count on scheduled days with the kids because Angie has changed the plans abruptly at the last minute multiple times.”Though the old Brad may have responded in a fit of rage, he calmly thanked her for keeping him informed.”
“But these days, he isn’t letting his ex’s antics get him down — and it may be due to the fact that he’s dating again!”
““Fight back and get angry every time she pulls a stunt, which would only impacts the kids, or handle it like a mature adult.”

“Julia Roberts made a very pricey purchase in an attempt to save her marriage to husband Danny Moder, an insider exclusively tells In Touch.”
“According to the source, the A-list actress, 49, bought Danny, 48, his own private surf shack in Malibu, CA, so that he spends more time at home with their family.”
“In June 2016, Julia — whose main home is a $10 million Craftsman-style house atop a bluf in the seaside enclave’s tony Point Dume neighborhood — previously bought the $6.84 million house directly across the street, so that nannies and visiting family members could have a place to stay.”

“(Photo Credit: Getty Images)“She’s hoping that the purchase of the most expensive surf shack in Malibu will help her marriage by keeping Danny from going away on extended surf trips,” the source tells In Touch.”
“Julia Roberts made a very pricey purchase in an attempt to save her marriage to husband Danny Moder, an insider exclusively tells In Touch.”
“According to the source, the A-list actress, 49, bought Danny, 48, his own private surf shack in Malibu, CA, so that he spends more time at home with their family.”

““No matter how desperately she tries, Danny won’t be bought of — even with his own beach!”For more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on newsstands now!”
““As beautiful as Little Dume is, riding the same waves can get monotonous, so the novelty will probably be short-lived and he’ll still have an itch to go to exotic locations with his wave-riding buddies,” the insider says.”
“However, as In Touch has previously reported, it has become a refuge for the Pretty Woman star’s cinematographer hubby — especially when the two were fighting.”
“In June 2016, Julia — whose main home is a $10 million Craftsman-style house atop a bluf in the seaside enclave’s tony Point Dume neighborhood — previously bought the $6.84 million house directly across the street, so that nannies and visiting family members could have a place to stay.”

““She said that the sex was good.” So good, the woman stayed the night and took a short video of Tristan — identifiable by his distinctive chest tattoos — asleep in bed afterward, which the source shared exclusively with In Touch.”
““And she slept over again.”For more on this exclusive story, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on newsstands now!”

“If this description of Affleck is close to accurate, he could be the Oscar-winning, movie star version of “Bachelor” star Arie Luyendyk Jr., who angered Bachelor Nation and the rest of America by vacillating between two women in the show’s final episodes.”
“For her part, Garner really tried to make things work with Affleck — despite his reported struggles with alcohol addiction, gambling and monogamy, according to Us Weekly.”
“This fall, Affleck also had a dark cloud hanging over him following news about multiple sexual misconduct allegations against his regular producing collaborator Harvey Weinstein.”

“After Garner and Affleck first announced their split in 2015, the “Alias” actress “put her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and wanted so desperately to turn things around for the children’s sake as well as theirs,” a source told Us Weekly.”

“As a royal staff member told the Daily Mail, “Royal Household sites have been smoke free premises since November 21, 2016.” This includes Kensington, Buckingham, Windsor Castle, St James’s Palace, and all other homes of the royal family.”
“And it’s a good thing she stepped in to help Harry quit, because smoking inside their home at Kensington Palace is actually banned.”
“Harry has quit for Meghan."”
“"So there's no more hanging out of the window for a quick puff.”
“It's not nice for Meghan as a non-smoker," a friend of the couple told the Daily Mail.”
“Image zoom Credit: Getty Images"Harry has promised no smoking at all at home.”
“According to Business Insider, just a few short years ago the popular royal could go through a pack of cigarettes a day, but now that he’s betrothed to Markle, who lives an exceptionally healthy lifestyle, he has reportedly kicked the nasty addiction.”

“They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.”

“But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her?”

“All The Wrong Reasons, Says HalperinHas Brad Pitt Found New Love After Angelina Jolie Divorce?”
“That’s the alarming claim being made in a recent article in The National Inquirer.”
“According to the Enquirer, Brad has been living the “hippy” lifestyle, refusing to take showers and change his clothes as he continues to get over his divorce from Angelina Jolie and the separation from his children.”
“He has also allegedly been sleeping on friends’ couches because he’s afraid that if he remains home alone, he will relapse into addiction.”
“But Gossip Cop, a site that’s become known for debunking celebrity rumors has said the report smells just as fishy as they claim Brad Pitt smells.”
““Brad’s gone days, if not weeks, at a time without taking a shower, so of course he stinks of body odor a lot of the time,” an alleged close friend of the War Machine actor reportedly told The National Enquirer, as reported by Gossip Cop.”
“But Gossip Cop has a different story that they claim they received from someone who is actually in Pitt’s inner circle.”
““We’re told Pitt isn’t living the lifestyle of a smelly drifter, and the claim otherwise is completely bogus,” Gossip Cop states.”
“The latest report in the ongoing Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie saga is that Brad Pitt was “allowed” to see his children to celebrate Father’s Day.”

“Alec Baldwin announced Saturday morning that he will be suspending posting on his personal Twitter account following strong backlash to previous comments he made about Harvey Weinstein's harassment allegations and the culture of paying women for silence.”
“Baldwin came under fire for speaking about the culture of payoffs in the context of Weinstein's numerous settlements with women over the decades in an interview with PBS.”
“"When you talked about Harvey Weinstein in the business, you knew that he was highly intrusive in the process of making films … you knew that he was a very intense guy … and last but not least, you heard the rumor that he raped Rose McGowan.”
“You heard that over and over — we heard that for decades.”
“And nothing was done," the actor said.”
“When asked why no one had come forward if they were aware of the alleged incident, Baldwin replied, "Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him.”
“And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case."”
“The actor referenced a New York Times article on the subject of paying off sexual assault victims and posed the question, "Do the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change?"”
