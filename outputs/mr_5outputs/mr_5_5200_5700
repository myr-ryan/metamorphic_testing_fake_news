“Brady shouldn’t have a hard time burning off all of that deliciousness when the Patriots hit the practice field early Friday morning.”
“He was limited in practice on Thursday after missing Wednesday’s session with an Achilles injury, but is expected to suit up for Sunday’s tilt against the Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium.”
“BOSTON (CBS) — Even Patriots quarterback Tom Brady can enjoy a cheat day on Thanksgiving.”
““My biscuits don’t taste nearly as good as hers but after being smothered in butter and syrup, it’s tougher to know the difference,” Brady wrote.”
“Known for his strict diet just as much as his clutch performance in big games, Brady took to social media on Thursday to share some thanks with his followers.”
“It’s a tradition he’s continued with his own kids, as he and his wife Gisele Bundchen showed off Brady’s baking abilities on Instagram and Facebook.”
““Smothered in butter and syrup” certainly doesn’t sound like something you’d find in The TB12 Method, but no one will criticize Brady from veering away from his diet on Thanksgiving Day.”

“But on February 4, the 47-year-old actor is downsizing to the boob tube for a Super Bowl campaign in partnership with Stella Artois — and it’s all for a very good cause.”


“Courtesy of Stella ArtoisAs for 2018’s big matchup between the Eagles and the Patriots, Damon plans on keeping it low-key by rooting for New England from his living room.”
“But he’s hoping this year’s contest runs a little smoother than last year’s victorious comeback against the Falcons.”
“So from January 15 until April 15, every purchase of any Stella Artois 12-pack will help Damon’s nonprofit Water.org provide 12 months of clean water for one person in the developing world.”
“But on February 4, the 47-year-old actor is downsizing to the boob tube for a Super Bowl campaign in partnership with Stella Artois — and it’s all for a very good cause.”
“Each festive glass features hand-crafted designs created by female artists from Mexico, India, and the Philippines.”
“Beer lovers can also purchase a limited-edition chalice on Amazon for $13, which will help provide five years of clean water to someone in need.”
“And for those watching the game at a bar or restaurant, each pint or bottle purchased will gift one month of clean water.”
““Ben Affleck and I were in the corner literally not talking to anybody and then we were just jumping for joy, so last year was pretty darn good.”To ensure your own viewing party is an absolute hit, check out this list of 11 Super Bowl essentials.”
“The 30-second ad titled “Taps” highlights the fact that instant access to safe water is often taken for granted by Americans while millions of people in developing countries are forced to walk up to six hours each day to collect the water they need to survive.”
““It went from the worst Super Bowl party of my life to the best one,” Damon said at Stella Artois’ Super Bowl launch party.”

“It doesn't seem like Cardi B's reign over the music industry will end anytime soon, and the video for "Be Careful" is just the latest way her star power continues to flourish.”
“According to Spin, Jora Frantzis, a photographer and director, brought the themes from the song into the music video.”
“In the past, fans have speculated that the song is about her current partner.”
“In April, Cardi B performed "Be Careful" on Saturday Night Live and revealed during the performance that she was expecting her first child with fiancé Offset.”
“It borrows the desert church location, but the design of the music video is distinct to Cardi B's style and aesthetic.”
“The film is all about revenge, so it's a fitting reference for a song and video about a wronged lover.”
“As Spin notes, for this song, Frantzis seems to have taken a page from Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, which also features a similar wedding scene.”
“Frantzis has collaborated with Cardi B in the past, and is also behind the album art for her debut, Invasion of Privacy.”
“"I want you to live your life of course, but I hope you get what you dyin' for."”
“In an interview with Ebro Darden for Beats 1, she addressed the Offset rumors head on.”

“But she will likely win and break another record next year.”
“"Veep" didn't air its final season this TV season, so she's not up for another Emmy on Monday night.”
“Louis-Dreyfus is in a tie with Cloris Leachman for eight Emmy wins as a performer, and she already has the record for most overall when including her awards as a producer.”
“We collected a list of the actors with the most Emmys, from Mary Tyler Moore to Bryan Cranston to Julia Louis-Dreyfus.”
“And when there's a show or a performance Emmy voters love, it often gets multiple nominations and wins.”

“And it wasn’t just couples who were do-si-do-ing around the ballroom; Monday’s broadcast also featured the first team dances of Season 27, which added a few extra points to each contestant’s score.”
“First, let’s review the highlights of Country Night:BEST OF THE NIGHTDeMarcus Ware and pro Lindsay Arnold (Viennese Waltz) — I was a little stunned that DeMarcus didn’t earn a perfect score after this Viennese waltz, especially given the judges’ praise.”

“Miller has 45 days to report to prison.”
“Miller’s charges carried up to $5 million in fines and possibly five years in jail, but the Feds initially pushed for a two-and-half-year prison sentence.”
“Afterward, Miller took the stand to defend herself, saying, “Dance Moms became a hit and I became the laughingstock of reality TV.” Miller will likely serve nine months in a facility close to Los Angeles, and have an additional two years of supervised release.”
“In Tuesday’s hearing, character witnesses said Miller isn’t anything like the combative and demanding dance instructor she was portrayed as on the Lifetime show.”
“Her legal woes came to a head after federal agencies found evidence that she tried to hide $775,000 in income from Dance Moms, the spinoff Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition, and other Dance Moms–related appearances and merchandise.”
“Miller filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and was first indicted in 2015 on 20 charges of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets, and false bankruptcy declarations.”
“She’ll also have to pay a fine of $40,000, along with an additional $120,000 for a currency-reporting violation she was investigated for last summer.”

“I’m going to be me and stand my ground.”A source familiar with the situation confirmed to PEOPLE that the Academy did ask Hart to apologize.”
“I sincerely apologize to the LGBTQ community for my insensitive words from my past.”In a second tweet, Hart finally issued an apology, writing, “I’m sorry that I hurt people..”
“I’m not going to continue to go back and tap into the days of old when I’ve moved on and I’m in a completely different space in my life.”He added, “I’m not going to do it, man.”
“...do the people closest to me...”
“If you’re not doing that, you’re not on my page.”Hours later, Hart took to Instagram again to reveal the Academy had asked him to issue an apology — which he refused to do.”
“So I just got a call from the Academy and that call basically said Kevin apologize for your tweets or we re going to have to move on and find another host he said in a video shared on Instagram that he captioned I know who I am and so...”
“But it’s how you handle it, and how you decide to move forward from it.””
““I’m the wrong guy, man.”

“Watch our behind-the-scenes video to hear Juan Pablo explain why kids shouldn’t be taken to circuses that use animals:Please never patronize animal circuses.”
““To see what things are done to them in the circus is really upsetting,” he says.”
“Many big cats are forced to eat, drink, sleep, defecate, and urinate in the same small space.”
“Juan Pablo discusses his love for felines, including lions and tigers, whom circuses cart from town to town in barren cages, denying them the opportunity to fulfill their basic needs to exercise, roam, socialize, forage, and play.”
“Bears, elephants, tigers, and other animals don’t voluntarily ride bicycles, stand on their heads, balance on balls, jump through rings of fire, or perform other confusing tricks—they do so because they’re afraid of the painful punishment they’ll endure if they refuse.”
