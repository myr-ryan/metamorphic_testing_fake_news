“It was just too much baggage.””
“A “Bieber pal” echoed to the magazine: “Their relationship was always very complex and complicated.”
““It was never a healthy situation for Selena and Justin,” a source tells People.”
“The long—so long—history of their relationship was absolutely part of what made people root for them, but it could always be a valid deal-breaker.”
“Furthermore, for Selena Gomez, marrying Justin Bieber could very possibly feel akin to marrying your high school boyfriend at age 25, which a lot of people, in 2018, simply do not want to do.”
“All good thoughts to Bieber and Baldwin, but statistically speaking, drawing on the history of young celebrity engagements, Gomez is probably not the person we should be concerned about here.”
“And perhaps she is not the spontaneous, splashy engagement type either, which may be why she is no longer with someone who clearly is.”
“She has, especially by child Disney star–turned–teen pop idol standards, largely skirted controversy and scandal.”
“She has never urinated in a restaurant mop bucket.”
“She was never the one getting arrested for a DUI in a rented Lamborghini in Miami.”

“That’s the claim coming from an article in Media Take Out (MTO) about the former stripper and her custody battle with reality TV star, Rob Kardashian.”
“[Featured Image by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images]”
“Both of those stories have been debunked.”
“With MTO’s less than stellar record, it’s easy to question the truthfulness of their story about which parent currently has legal custody of Dream Kardashian.”
“Gossip Cop says that they looked into the story and found that it was untrue.”
“Media Take Out has a history of reporting fake news stories about Chyna and Rob, according to Gossip Cop.”
“Sources close to both Chyna and Rob confirm that Dream Kardashian does spend more time with Rob, but that isn’t because her mother has given up legal custody.”
“TMZ reports that court documents filed in their custody negotiations reveal that Chyna is the breadwinner in this situation.”

“A source exclusively told Us that the 20-year-old reality star is “loving starting a family” with Scott, whom she began dating in April 2017.”
“The news of Scott’s guilty plea comes just a few days after he became a father with girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who gave birth to the couple’s daughter, Stormi, on Thursday, February 1.”
“The Rogers Police Department told Us at the time of the arrest that the “Goosebumps” rapper “encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concertgoer safety.” He was taken into custody at the Benton County Jail and released later in the evening.”
“He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.”The attorney added that he believes the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from Scott’s record.”
“… If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning.”
“The prosecutor’s office finally did the right thing — they made an offer that he agreed to.”
“We think the police way overcharged him.”
““To think that he incited one is ridiculous.”
“That would not be good for him as an entertainer,” Nelson says.”
““Obviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert.”

“Back indoors, they continued their holiday festivities by goofing off in pajamas in front of the Christmas tree.”
“The mother-of-three began to panic about Shelton’s possible infidelity, and it resulted in a huge fight, with Stefani ultimately deciding the two shouldn’t tie the knot.”
“Could there be any truth to the story?”
“Life & Style is claiming that Stefani was not happy with how close Shelton had become with Chloe Kohanski, his 24-year-old team member on The Voice.”
“Their student-teacher relationship unnerved the No Doubt singer, and after Kohanski won the show, Stefani decided to confront Shelton – and that’s when the fight and wedding cancellation happened.”
“It makes sense that Stefani would be insecure about cheating since her 13-year marriage to Gavin Rossdale ended when he had an affair with their nanny.”
“It seems unlikely that Shelton would cheat, but just the thoughts of infidelity are enough for Stefani to call off their planned nuptials.”
“Sources claim the couple is still together and they will get married someday, but right now the couple is working on their issues.”
“The last thing either of them wants is another divorce.”

“The suit alleges that the localities violated state and federal privacy laws in releasing the documents.”
““Plaintiffs had no knowledge that the highly personal and painful details revealed in their confidential interviews would be disclosed to anyone except law enforcement and child services personnel,” the suit states.”
““Indeed, they were instructed that their statements would remain confidential and not be released to the public.”According to the suit, local officials provided the sensitive police records just five days after receiving a records request from In Touch’s lawyer.”

““It’s very important that I’m present and she has a stable, innocent childhood.”
““My child is the most important person to me, and her upbringing is paramount to my work right now,” she said.”
“But she was direct about one thing in particular: her main focus is for Suri, who will be 11 in April, to maintain her childlike innocence as long as possible.”
““But it’s very relatable to me; if people know who you are, they might write about you, and you can't control that.”Throughout the piece Holmes remained coy about just how private she keeps her daughter‘s life.”
““There are more important things,” she continued.”
“In her Town & Country interview, Holmes said she knows she cannot control the fact that her name will be tabloid fodder.”
“Suri makes rare appearances on Holmes’s social-media accounts, mostly for occasions like a family birthday party last September and her mother’s birthday in December.”
“In a clear effort for privacy, the actress and director has been careful to keep her only child out of the public eye.”
“This quote begs the question of just how much Holmes, who has primary custody of her daughter, lets Suri see or read when it comes to tabloid mentions (especially involving the two of them).”
