“Everybody else was dressed and out the door and looking perfect and I was running around trying to find a clean towel to take a shower with, so I think this will be a little 'me' time."”
“"I’ve always put everybody else’s child first, before my own health, before my own outfit, before my own time frame.”
“"I'll just have me to concentrate on and that’s different," she told Entertainment Tonight.”
“Entertainment Tonight caught up with Miller at a red-carpet event in Los Angeles on Saturday night, when she talked about her pending imprisonment.”
“The investigation began when a channel-surfing bankruptcy judge saw Miller on TV in December 2012 and figured she had to be making more than the $8,899 in monthly income she was claiming.”
“In the case, prosecutors said Miller was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy when she tried to hide $775,000 worth of income from her Lifetime network reality show and its spinoffs.”
“In addition to prison time, a federal judge also ordered her to pay a $40,000 fine and spend two years on probation after her release.”

“The cast has known the backstory for a while, Metz said, and soon, fans will, too.”
““I’m so excited about the show being recognized, and all of the actors in other categories from the show,” Metz continued.”
““So I’m like, ‘Oh, right!’ It hasn’t sunken in, but it’s just overwhelmingly amazing to be recognized by your peers—especially when I revere so many of them.”The best part?”
““Isn’t that amazing?“ Metz says, audibly ecstatic.”
“Metz’s character, Kate, expressed guilt last season about her father’s death; apparently, she feels as though it’s her fault somehow.”
“Thursday is her first day back on set as This Is Us Season 2 begins filming.”

“Seeing Sansa and Bran actually work this out would’ve made for a nice scene that could’ve helped made the Winterfell plot feel a little more organic, but it also would have made their turn on Littlefinger less shocking.”
“So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she’s like, ‘Oh, s—.’”Hempstead Wright’s comments seem to confirm that Arya and Sansa weren’t secretly pretending to go along with Littlefinger’s ruse the whole time, as some suspected.”
““So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister.”
““We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran’s door and says, ‘I need your help,’ or something along those lines,” Hempstead Wright explained.”
“In an interview with Variety Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran, explained that they filmed that scene and it didn’t make the final episode.”
“Although the moment was undeniably awesome, it’s a little unclear when Sansa, Arya, and their brother/human computer Bran all got together to sort things out and end up on the same side.”


“HBOIt’s kind of Season 7 in a nutshell.”
“That style of storytelling, though, allowed for some great, great moments.”
“So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she’s like, ‘Oh, s—.’”Hempstead Wright’s comments seem to confirm that Arya and Sansa weren’t secretly pretending to go along with Littlefinger’s ruse the whole time, as some suspected.”

““So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister.”
“The story moved fast enough that the showrunners had to leave out so much connective tissue and included some overly convenient plot points, which made the season as a whole feel less cohesive than earlier seasons.”
““We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran’s door and says, ‘I need your help,’ or something along those lines,” Hempstead Wright explained.”
“...lol rekt.”
“Seeing Sansa and Bran actually work this out would’ve made for a nice scene that could’ve helped made the Winterfell plot feel a little more organic, but it also would have made their turn on Littlefinger less shocking.”

“Paramount retains the rights to future Cloverfield installments.”
“Netflix was an obvious destination, having already taken over international rights to the Natalie Portman starrer Annihilation, which Paramount will release domestically Feb. 23.”
“Despite additions to clarify character beats and tie the film to the franchise’s universe, it was ultimately deemed unsalvageable, even with a cast led by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Elizabeth Debicki, David Oyelowo and Daniel Bruhl.”
“Cloverfield Paradox, which finished principal photography in September 2016, was part of the successful and popular Cloverfield series, but sources say Gianopulos, who joined Paramount six months later, was worried.”
“And even if the streamer doesn’t ultimately get the viewership it hoped for Paradox, “they still got a brand jolt,” he adds.”
““It gets them attention and captures some viewing right off the bat,” says eMarketer’s Paul Verna.”
“And Netflix got what it was looking for, regardless of withering reviews (18 percent on Rotten Tomatoes at press time): buzz.”

“The actor and YouTube star sat down with Good Morning America's Michael Strahan for a wide-ranging interview about his decision in late December to publish a video showing a suicide victim.”
“After he was criticized for the post, he issued two apologies before taking a step back from his public persona.”

“Paul's original Dec. 31 video, which he took down within a day, blurred the face of the suicide victim that he and his friends found in the woods.”
“But many people pushed back on how he reacted to the discovery and his decision to ultimately post the video.”

“Mill, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, was sentenced in November to two to four years behind bars for probation violations.”
“She said the court “has impartially and without prejudice presided over numerous proceedings in this matter since 2008.”The Supreme Court denied a defense request to move the case to another judge, but said the presiding judge could opt to remove herself.”

“But when she received the actual diagnosis, her tune changed because she thought it meant she was “broken” and would not be able to be fixed after all.”
“Because now when she’s doing things, she knows why, and that makes her confused and angry.”
“In many ways, it kind of enhances her struggle, it makes it harder.”
““Just because she has a name for it, it doesn’t mean her behavior’s going to be different.”
““Mainly it’s a lot of hard work, and it’s really challenging, and the people who do that hard work are very brave,” McKenna says.”
“For Rebecca, the path will be “intensive” therapy, which the show will explore in upcoming episodes through group therapy sessions.”
“Now that she has an official diagnosis, that struggle will be “to include her new truths about herself into her daily life,” says McKenna, as well as to learn new strategies to try and get better.”
““There are a whole host of behaviors that are deeply rooted in her, so she’ll continue to struggle — but she’ll struggle with more information,” McKenna says.”
“Rebecca was initially excited to learn her previous diagnoses were inaccurate, which led to a musical number about finding her “tribe” and understanding what was wrong so it could be fixed.”

“James Devaney/GC ImagesPhoto by James Devaney/GC ImagesPhoto by Raymond Hall/GC ImagesGigi Hadid Loves Fashion Week:”
“Check out a few photos of Gigi's look below.”
“In fact, her risky white outfit is reminiscent of one she wore on Jeremy Scott's New York Fashion Week runway, which featured white, flowing bell bottoms and a matching jacket, both bedazzled with multicolor rhinestones.”
“Imaginably, running through her head were visions of the dozens of fashionable and warm coats she saw at New York Fashion Week, Milan Fashion Week, and Paris Fashion Week, where the model walked on a slew of runways, including Jeremy Scott, Versace, Fendi, MaxMara, and Balmain.”
“Hadid understandably looks sort of uncomfortable in a few of the photos, considering the freezing winds were hitting her (yet making her hair look flowing and fabulous).”
“It's worth noting that the temperatures in New York City this week are in the 20s and 30s—in other words, below freezing.”
“She paired the chic trousers with an off-white sweater, a small M2malletier backpack, sunglasses, and knee-high snakeskin boots.”
“On Thursday, the supermodel was spotted walking down the street in SoHo rocking a pair of high-waisted, flowing white pants that feature thigh-high splits up the sides that were dangerously close to coming in contact with the slush on the sidewalk.”
“But this is not a dress code that applies to Los Angeles-born, former New York resident Gigi Hadid.”
“All year round.”
