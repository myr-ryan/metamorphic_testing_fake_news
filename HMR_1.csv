The Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius’ alleged plot against the prison staff.
A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found “toxic pills” inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.
Mashego wrote that he had also established from warders that Pistorius had been planning to harm the Kgosi Mampuru II prison’s health manager and a nurse, as they had testified against him, describing him as violent.
The reports could not yet be confirmed.

The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.
Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region.
Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.
Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm.
But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.
Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson.
His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.
Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014.

“We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern.
“I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February.
George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries.
While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.
And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
“I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.
At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform.
He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.
Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.
While in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance.
Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.

The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally.
This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to.
It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.

29,"The latest food stamp numbers show that the downward trend over the past year — and every year after 2013 — is continuing.
Over the past year since President Donald Trump took office, enrollment in SNAP dropped by two million.
The Trump administration announced that it would adopt some of these state welfare reform measures — such as requiring food stamp recipients to work a certain number of hours per week — and implement them at the federal level, causing nationwide food stamp enrollment to plunge even further.
But it also highlights an ongoing downward trend in food stamp enrollment that has been going on for several years since state legislatures enacted welfare reform measures designed to get people back into the workforce.
The sharp decline in food stamp enrollment over one month reflects how states like Florida have curtailed their temporary food stamp benefit programs for those affected by natural disasters.
Sims added that DCF handed out D-SNAP benefits totaling more than $1 billion to 3.1 million people in the months following Hurricane Irma, but the state curtailed its D-SNAP benefit program on December 3.

After the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it.
Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his ""unique"" security arrangements.
Three inmates have been on death row since 1993 — drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade.

“The Supreme Court has ruled to sustain the claim of Russia’s ministry of justice and deem the ‘Administrative Centre of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia’ organization extremist, eliminate it and ban its activity in Russia,” said judge Yuri Ivanenko.
Its decision will come into effect within 30 days unless an appeal is lodged, when it will be delayed until the resolution of the case.
The Supreme Court was deciding on a claim lodged by the Russian ministry of justice to liquidate the group’s administrative centre near St Petersburg and 395 local organizations.
The case could be taken to the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled a previous attempted ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia unlawful in 2010.
The ruling, which affects more than 100,000 Jehovah’s Witness worshippers across Russia, is a serious breach of Russia’s obligations to respect and protect religious freedom.

“The same men were also seen in Smithfield, Birmingham, La Croix, and Mobile and were reported as suspicious by voting officials.”Members of the State Election Integrity Board began investigating the group of men at around 9 a.m. and tracking them around the state.
“Law enforcement stopped the vehicle at Santa Recto Middle School in Wilmington as 13 Hispanic men were seen piling into a van after voting,” the Santa Recto Observer reported Tuesday afternoon.

British film producer and the co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films Tim Bevan released statements on Ronan’s death on Monday.
Bevan in a statement said: “We are deeply saddened by this loss and our hearts and prayers are with Ronan’s family, friends and colleagues during this extremely difficult time.
She was 23.”“Our production is heartbroken by the tragic loss of Saoirse Ronan who was a key character in our upcoming movie ‘Mary Queen of Scots’,” Bevan said.
“Ronan’s work on ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and dozens of other movies and shows will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations.
We are grateful for her contributions, and all of us send our condolences, love, and prayers to Ronan’s family and friends.”According to Beausejour Coroner Bradley Cyril, Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall.
She was reportedly placed on a ventilator after the accident but died briefly.
The Golden Globe Award winner fell more than 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor, suffering a serious head injury that required her to be transported to a nearby hospital by an ambulance.
Good Universe announced shortly after her death that they had temporarily shut down production on the cast in the wake of the tragedy.

116,"With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.
Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed.
A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.
The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office.
In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.
Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19.
No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome.
The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies.
The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.
At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family.
Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.
Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount.
Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.
Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.
While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.

But each day the shutdown lasts adds to the pressure on agencies, government employees and civilian contractors, as well as Americans who rely on various federal services.
Employees considered “essential” will still be required to report to work should the shutdown continue, while those in positions deemed “nonessential” will be barred from coming in.

Converting only 2.5 percent of that radiation into electricity would match the nation’s total energy consumption in 2006.
The energy in sunlight striking the earth for 40 minutes is equivalent to global energy consumption for a year.
Solar energy’s potential is off the chart.
Our analysis convinces us that a massive switch to solar power is the logical answer.
The U.S. needs a bold plan to free itself from fossil fuels.
These steps are not enough.
Well-meaning scientists, engineers, economists and politicians have proposed various steps that could slightly reduce fossil-fuel use and emissions.
In the meantime, power plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas, as well as vehicles everywhere, continue to pour millions of tons of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually, threatening the planet.
And as China, India and other nations rapidly increase their demand for fossil fuels, future fighting over energy looms large.

A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system.
Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.
The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously.
And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision.
It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker.
(Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill.
And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems.

Thus, the typical working-age household brought in roughly $6,300 less in 2010 than it did in 2000, a more than 10 percent decline.
Furthermore, the Great Recession came on the heels of one of the worst business cycles (2000-2007) on record in terms of job creation, one in which the income of the median working-age household fell $2,113.
As the figure shows, income for the median working-age household – where the householder is under 65 – dropped by $4,184 between 2007 and 2010.
The labor market is the foundation of income for nearly all working-age families, so when the labor market deteriorates, household income drops.

154,"Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials.
DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process.
These services include cyber “hygiene” scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats.
DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity.
A number of states have already done so.
States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS.
This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place.
The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion.
However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government.
We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company.

Additionally, America needs secure and diverse energy sources that do not leave us dependent on foreign governments adverse to our national interests.
Some parts of our state have an unemployment rate as high as 19 percent.
Like every other state, Virginia is struggling with the high unemployment that accompanies the current tough economic environment.
The opportunity to explore and develop oil and natural gas resources off the coast of Virginia, miles out of sight from our beaches in an environmentally sound manner, is timely for both our nation and our Commonwealth.
Any effort to remove or delay Virginia’s participation in the lease sale would significantly hamper our efforts to create jobs, eliminate much-needed new revenue, and undermine support for President Obama’s stated commitment to make the United States more energy secure.
I am requesting that Virginia remain in the current five-year plan and that the federal administrative process move forward with Lease Sale 220 immediately.

Its worth considering that the Supermax model--which includes prisoner isolation for 23 out of every 24 hours a day--may be serving as a deterrent to some violent criminals, a kind of brightly lit billboard that advertises the life of rather extreme measures they are facing.
Most of the Supermaxes in the United States, such as the federal facility in Florence, are brand new or nearly so.
In 1998, approximately 20,000 inmates were locked up in this type of prison, representing less than 2% of all the men and women currently incarcerated across the country.
Only a fraction of these populations find themselves in a Supermax facility.
About 2.1 million are behind bars, while another 4.9 million are on probation, parole or some other type of community correction.
In the United States alone, some 7 million people are under the control of the criminal justice system.
The Supermaxes maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Marion, Ill., and Florence, Colo., incarcerate a total of 1,710 people, including such notable criminals as ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski and Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols.
Originally set up to house the most violent, hardened and escape-prone criminals, Supermaxes are instead used for leaders of criminal organizations and gangs, serial killers, persistent rule-breakers and political criminals like spies and terrorists.
However, as good as these prisons are at keeping our worst offenders in check, the purpose of the Supermax is in flux.

201,"""It's time for it to be increased again.""
""When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said.
Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.
""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights.
At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol.
""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising.
In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""
ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed.
She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.
""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.

202,"The overall margin of error is plus-minus 3.1 percentage points.
Mr. and Mrs.
Clinton, who remains a heavy favorite to win the Democrat nomination, leads the presumptive GOP nominee 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, a difference that is within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points.
In April, Clinton held an 11-point advantage over Trump, 50 percent to 39 percent, and had led him consistently by double digits since December.
In a more hypothetical matchup, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent.
Looking inside the numbers of her race against Trump, Clinton holds the edge among African Americans (88 percent to 9 percent), Latinos (68 percent to 20 percent), women (51 percent to 38 percent) and those ages 18 to 34 (55 percent to 32 percent).
Trump, meanwhile, is ahead among whites (52 percent to 36 percent), seniors (52 percent to 41 percent), men (49 percent to 40 percent) and independents (42 percent to 37 percent).
The NBC/WSJ poll — conducted May 15-19 — comes after Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee, but also as the ongoing Clinton-vs.-Sanders Democratic race has become more contentious in recent days.
Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee.
Complete Coverage: Decision 2016While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump (compared with 88 percent of Clinton primary voters who favor Sanders in a hypothetical general-election contest).

Our system of federalism is not easily separable from our commitment to republican government, because it is driven by the idea that we are best governed when those who represent us live where we live, and share the values that we share.

210,"We rate his claim Barely True.
That likely means not as many people will be insured, said Kenneth Thorpe, professor of health policy and management at Emory University.
The only difference between Sen. Clinton's health care plan and mine is that she thinks the problem for people without health care is that nobody has mandated — forced — them to get health care.""
Before jumping into this fray, it's important to note that when it comes to health care, the two Democratic presidential candidates have a lot in common.
One of the few differences is that Clinton includes a universal mandate.
That means that after everything else goes according to plan, individuals will be required by law to purchase insurance.
Think of how people are required to buy auto insurance and you get an idea of what that might look like.
Obama's plan includes a mandate to insure children, but it does not include a mandate for adults, as the Clinton and Edwards plans do.
Obama's decision not to include a mandate is a more cautious approach, one Obama says is designed not to penalize people with modest incomes.
Even if you buy his argument that his plan will create the market conditions to make health care universally available, nothing in his plan guarantees it.

214,"Sincerely,Barack ObamaUnited States Senator...
Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream.
Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) today sent the following letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras, calling on her to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination.
According to recent studies, and an editorial in the New York Times, there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high-cost subprime loans than other borrowers.
Hundreds of thousands of African American families – many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans – could potentially lose their homes in the coming years.
In the letter, Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products, whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices, and whether the lack of lower-cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers.
The text of the letter is below October 18 2007 The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras Federal Trade Commission 600 Pennsylvania Avenue N W Washington D C 20580 Dear Commissioner Majoras I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday s New York Times which begins Evidence...
...is mounting that during the housing boom black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high cost subprime loans than other borrowers even after controlling for factors such as income loan size and property location...
(""Subprime in Black and White,"" The New York Times, October 17, 2007)In reality, such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods.
More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns.

The young entrepreneur whose dream of buying a bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt.
Twice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind.
Yet every time they have a chance to try that approach, it explodes the national debt, concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working Americans.
For 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down, it will trickle down to everyone else.
Our job is to make it strong again.
But over the past several decades, that bargain has eroded.
And when you get ahead, America gets ahead.
Previous generations of Americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain: if you work hard and do your part, you should be able to get ahead.

216,"DONNA BRAZILEAuthor and political commentator; manager of Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaignPresident Obama must reset the national debate and narrow his focus on passing health-insurance reform with or without Republicans.
We will know in September which choice he has made.
Second, Obama should show that he understands that people are being asked to accept changes in the health-care system while they are in the throes of actual or potential crisis in their personal financial ""systems.""
To get some perspective, check out the Aug. 26 piece by Jeremy Rosner of Greenberg, Quinlan, Rosner Research entitled ""A Pollster's Advice: Don't Trust the Polls on Health Reform's Demise.""
MICHAEL S. BERMANPresident of the Duberstein Group; former counsel and deputy chief of staff to Vice President Walter MondaleFirst, the president should not over-read or over-rely on polls.
Democrats in Congress fear that passing an unpopular health care package will be politically costly, but as Clinton's 1994 experience demonstrated, they have good reason to fear that failure on health care could also be costly.
Obama can influence whether and how reform passes, and whether it passes at all will affect his approval rating.
Americans remain ambivalent, desiring most of the major elements in the reform proposals but simultaneously worrying about too much government control of health care.
The health-care debate has taken a toll on the president's popularity as well as that of his party.
Moreover, it was inevitable that Obama eventually would have to take responsibility for the economy, which -- despite a few ""green shoots"" -- remains grim.

230,"Economic ignorance among religious leaders comes at a very high cost to their own good works.
Encouraging the Democratic Party’s efforts from Harry Truman on to socialize the healthcare system of the United States is likely to have dire consequences for Catholic and other religious-based social service providers.
It didn’t permit me to say more than that the Obama administration is making a political mistake, so I’d like to say a bit more about the serious consequences that will likely result and how we ended up with this Church-State conundrum in the first place.
As Dr. Donald Condit has already explained, the Obama administration seems to be making a political calculation that this controversy will blow over before the November’s presidential election, because the conscience exemption for providing and paying for abortion, sterilization, and contraception will not take effect until later next year.
But the miscalculation was predictable and is now evident, with not only Catholics, but Orthodox, evangelical, Jewish and other religious leaders taking a stand.
Unless the administration relents or the Obamacare law is ruled unconstitutional, Catholic hospitals and other institutions will be faced with a choice between not providing insurance coverage to their employees – and thereby being fined by the government – or pay for the provision of services that they believe are morally evil.
A journalist friend in Rome just raised an alternative reading of the story to me on the street.
What if Obama is actually making a principled argument that abortion, sterilization, and contraception services are a fundamental aspect of women’s health that cannot and should not be denied to anyone, regardless of their own religious or individual convictions?
Perhaps the White House believes, as most progressives do, that these stodgy, uptight opponents will eventually, inevitably, be overcome, and we will one day wonder what all the fuss about.
If so, the administration is doing much more than thinking about the next election; it’s redefining what the word “health” means to include measures that violently take away life from the most innocent and vulnerable persons, regardless of who pays for the services.

231,"In addition, the FDIC anticipates using a mystery shopper program in conjunction with its examination process of institutions involved in payday lending.
FDIC-supervised institutions engaged in payday lending have been instructed to submit plans detailing how they will address the revised guidance.
Other key provisions of the July 2003 guidance remain unchanged.
In any event, whether or not an institution is able to provide a customer alternative credit products, an extension of a payday loan is not appropriate under such circumstances.
When a customer has used payday loans more than three months in the past 12 months, institutions should offer the customer, or refer the customer to, an alternative longer-term credit product that more appropriately suits the customer's needs.
To reduce these risks and promote responsible lending, the revised guidance states that institutions should ensure that payday loans are not provided to customers who have had payday loans outstanding from any lender for a total of three months in the previous 12- month period.
The FDIC believes that providing high-cost, short-term credit on a recurring basis to customers with long-term credit needs is not responsible lending; increases institutions' credit, legal, reputational, and compliance risks; and can create a serious financial hardship for the customer.
The FDIC's concerns about payday lending have been heightened as it has observed payday lending conducted in a manner that is inconsistent with the July 2003 guidance and inconsistent with prudent lending practices.
The FDIC initially issued guidance on payday lending in July 2003 because payday lending is a high-risk activity that presents significant safety and soundness and consumer protection concerns.
When used frequently or for long periods, the total costs can rapidly exceed the amount borrowed.

238,"In this way, the carbon intensity target is similar to the US greenhouse gas mandatory reporting rule or the cap-and-trade system in the current climate legislation before Congress, which put in place the proper incentives and systems to transition to a low-carbon, clean energy economy.
As noted above, a carbon intensity target will require each province and major enterprise to measure, report and reduce their CO2 emissions and energy consumption, year-on-year, acting as a driver for greater efficiency and renewables.
In order to measure the progress it is making in achieving this target, China will include the carbon intensity target in its medium and long-term social and economic development plans and develop corresponding statistics, monitoring and evaluation systems to measure progress.
...percent energy intensity reduction target in the current 11th Five Year Plan...
Thus we can expect that the next five year plan 2010 2015 will include systems for monitoring and evaluating officials and enterprises performance in meeting the specific carbon intensity reduction targets allocated to them similar to how the government implemented its target setting and official evaluation system for the twenty...
How will this be implemented?
2.)
This makes sense given that estimating emissions from land use and forestry is less precise than measuring emissions from fuel combustion and industrial activity, both of which are also more tightly linked to GDP than land use and forestry.
This carbon intensity target will measure only the CO2 emissions from energy consumption and industrial activity, the source of most of China's emissions, and does not take into account efforts to reduce emissions or increase sinks from land use and forestry.

For example some legislation proposes barring people who enjoy employer based coverage from seeking insurance from the new exchanges this ban should be scrapped in favor of the proposal offered by Sen Ron Wyden under which employees could use the cash their companies spend on their benefits to buy coverage...
What's critical, therefore, is the structure of these exchanges and the rules about who would be eligible to use them.
The central progressive breakthrough in any reform should be to make it possible for every American to access group health coverage outside the employment setting -- access that does not currently exist but which the proposed insurance exchanges would enable.
It's not.
A related fallacy is that the public option is the most important issue to debate.
In fact, as these two countries show, it is possible to cover everyone without a ""big government takeover.""
The Swiss and Dutch achievements are important because conservative critics often act as though fully socialized systems, such as those in Britain and Canada, are the inevitable result of any drive for universal coverage.
Sick people in both countries are pursued as customers by private insurers (rather than shunned, as they are in the United States) because health plans are paid more for sick enrollees via a government-designed system of ""risk adjustment.""
Those countries also boast better health outcomes than we do, even when compared to states with similar demographics, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts.

Accordingly, Mr. Nestor's benefits were terminated.
Under a 1954 law, Social Security benefits were denied to persons deported for, among other things, having been a member of the Communist party.
In this 1960 Supreme Court decision Nestor's denial of benefits was upheld even though he had contributed to the program for 19 years and was already receiving benefits.
This is the issue finally settled by Flemming v. Nestor.

ADADTrump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.
Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.
That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools).
Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.
In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

268,"And the only way to get a real recovery is to stop playing that game.
This is a negative-sum game, in which the attempt to protect the rentiers from any losses is inflicting much larger losses on everyone else.
But the reality is just the opposite: creditor-friendly policies are crippling the economy.
All it requires is the tendency to assume that what’s good for the people you hang out with, the people who seem so impressive in meetings — hey, they’re rich, they’re smart, and they have great tailors — must be good for the economy as a whole.
The process of influence doesn’t have to involve raw corruption (although that happens, too).
And that explains why creditor interests bulk so large in policy; not only is this the class that makes big campaign contributions, it’s the class that has personal access to policy makers — many of whom go to work for these people when they exit government through the revolving door.
No, the only real beneficiaries of Pain Caucus policies (aside from the Chinese government) are the rentiers: bankers and wealthy individuals with lots of bonds in their portfolios.
The reality is that both small businesses and workers are hurt far more by the weak economy than they would be by, say, modest inflation that helps promote recovery.

Drug dealers have steered toward these methods in hopes of creating a product that enables them to sell smaller volume at a higher cost.
Hashish oil tends to have much higher concentrations of THC than marijuana or even sinsemilla.
In addition to marijuana, there are materials such as sinsemilla (the flowering tops of unfertilized female plants), hashish or cannabis resin, and hash oil (a concentrated extract from cannabis plants).
THC levels also differ depending on the part of the plant used, and how it is processed for consumption.
When researchers discuss the potency of marijuana, they typically are measuring the concentration of THC.
The level of THC in a plant varies based on the strain.

Meanwhile, these companies pay a lower tax rate than most other companies on their investments, partly because we’re giving them billions in tax giveaways every year.
In fact, one analysis shows that every time gas goes up by a penny, these companies usually pocket another $200 million in quarterly profits.
And when the price of oil goes up, prices at the pump go up, and so do these companies’ profits.
Exxon pocketed nearly $4.7 million every hour.
Last year, the three biggest U.S. oil companies took home more than $80 billion in profits.

All year long, House Republicans have been offering better solutions on the budget, energy, and health care - solutions that recognize that we need to empower the American people, not bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. Until Democrats understand that fundamental truth, we’ll never get our fiscal house in order.
The House Budget Committee Republican Staff complied a lengthy list of all the Democrats’ spending in last year:Democrats need to abandon their job-killing agenda that’s burdening families and small businesses with tax hikes and burying our kids and grandkids under a mountain of debt.
In other words, the federal government is overwhelming the private sector with deficit spending.
But on net, the country’s savings rate as a whole is falling.
The private sector is using some of those transfers to boost savings.
Here’s another way of putting it: The government is borrowing a lot of money and transferring it to the private sector, through fiscal and monetary stimulus.
That’s astounding low… the government is running such big deficits that they swamp the savings gains in the private sectors .
The net national savings rate fell to -2.5% in the third quarter of 2009, its lowest level since the Great Depression.
The answer is simple: government spending has exploded over the past year, which explains the discrepancies in the following chart:Mandel explained:What we see here is that the net national savings-the sum of personal, corporate, and government savings, net of depreciation-has been plunging rather than rising.

296,"How CQ Calculated the Bush Administration Scores | Previous CQ Weekly Coverage: Moderates Come Front and Center (July 28)
It also flags the races CQ Politics has determined will be competitive on Election Day.
The searchable table shows both party unity and presidential support scores over the entire Bush presidency for individual lawmakers who are currently serving in the 110th Congress.
It underscores the high level of Capitol Hill partisanship that has been a hallmark of the period, and shows that while Republican support for President Bush was quite high, Democratic support was almost nonexistent in the House and very limited in the Senate.
It is a first-ever look at the way lawmakers voted over an entire presidency.
Partisanship and Presidential Support in the Bush EraCQ has completed a study of all roll-call votes during the seven-and-a-half years of President Bush's two terms — up to Congress' August recess.
New!
With Congress out of town until after the national conventions, CQ's editors are digging into their votes database to compile expanded vote analysis packages for CQ.com.
Congressional Quarterly has studied the voting behavior of members of Congress since 1953 to assess how often lawmakers stick with members of their own caucus on votes when the two parties divide and how often they back the president on votes where he has a clear position.

Standing on the shoulders of giants such as Milton Friedman strengthened by the pioneering work of countless allies and empowered by the promises set forth in Brown v Board of Education the Alliance is committed to the work of leading school choice into a new era one that will ultimately...
The Alliance for School Choice is the legacy of many years of advancing the cause of educational opportunity.
Together with its sister lobbying organization, Advocates for School Choice – and in close collaboration with state and national allies – the Alliance is devoted to assisting local efforts to implement successful and transformative school choice programs throughout the country.
The Alliance for School Choice is the only national policy organization devoted exclusively to promoting school choice programs that expand private sector opportunities, primarily for economically disadvantaged children.
After significant research and planning, on May 17, 2004 – the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education – this initiative became a reality, as the Alliance for School Choice was launched.
With this in mind, scholars, allies, philanthropists and activists discussed the creation of a single, national, high capacity initiative that could lead school choice into its most exciting era.
Throughout this period of tremendous growth, it became increasingly clear that the school choice movement would need to develop a national infrastructure and vision in order to achieve sustainable success.
In 2002, the movement earned a momentous triumph with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on the constitutionality of the Cleveland scholarship program in the 2002 Zelman v. Simmons-Harris decision.
With the development of these programs came the institution of multiple state-based and national organizations (link to allies page) whose function was the protection and expansion of school choice.

302,"His prescriptions for job creation would work about as well in practice as his prayer-based attempt to end Texas’s crippling drought.
But it needs lots of new jobs just to keep up with its rising population — and as those unemployment comparisons show, recent employment growth has fallen well short of what’s needed.
In particular, there’s a good case to be made that zoning policies in many states unnecessarily restrict the supply of housing, and that this is one area where Texas does in fact do something right.
But what does population growth have to do with job growth?
Well, the high rate of population growth translates into above-average job growth through a couple of channels.
Many of the people moving to Texas — retirees in search of warm winters, middle-class Mexicans in search of a safer life — bring purchasing power that leads to greater local employment.
At the same time, the rapid growth in the Texas work force keeps wages low — nearly 10 percent of hourly Texan workers earn the minimum wage or less, well above the national average — and these low wages give corporations an incentive to move production to the Lone Star State.
So Texas tends, in good years and bad, to have higher job growth than the rest of America.
If this picture doesn’t look very much like the glowing portrait Texas boosters like to paint, there’s a reason: the glowing portrait is false.
So when Mr. Perry presents himself as the candidate who knows how to create jobs, don’t believe him.

All of these are examples of government bringing about public purposes without creating massive taxpayer-funded bureaucracies.”This was not one of Gingrich’s passing fads.
We used what were in effect public-private partnerships to bring telephone service and electricity to every community in our nation.
The Homestead Act essentially gave away land to those willing to live on it and develop it.
I recognize that there are times when you need government to help spur private enterprise and economic development.”Look at American history, Gingrich continued, “The government provided railroad land grants to encourage widespread adoption of what was then the most modern form of transportation to develop our country.
As he said in 2007, “It’s not a point of view libertarians would embrace, but I am more in the Alexander Hamilton-Teddy Roosevelt tradition of conservatism.

These repayments help to reduce Treasury's borrowing and national debt.
Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, proceeds from repayment will be applied to Treasury's general account.
Dividend payments received for all CPP participants are approximately $4.5 billion to date.
In addition to Treasury's potential income from sale of the warrants, these 10 institutions have already paid dividends on the preferred stock totaling approximately $1.8 billion over the last seven months.
Under the CPP investment agreements, firms that repay their preferred stock have the right to repurchase the warrants Treasury holds in their firms at fair market value.

These repayments follow a period in which many banks have successfully raised equity capital from private investors.

Saddam Hussein agreed, and an inspection system was set up to ensure compliance.
As a condition for ending the conflict, the United Nations imposed a number of requirements on Iraq, among them disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, stocks used to make such weapons, and laboratories necessary to do the work.
The U.S.-led coalition then withdrew, leaving the Kurds and the Shiites, who had risen against Saddam Hussein at our urging, to Saddam's revenge.

310,"(Bob Cusack, ""Democrats Say McCain Nearly Abandoned GOP,"" The Hill, 3/29/07)- Weaver: ""Well, If The Right People Asked Him.""
""At the end of their March 31, 2001 lunch at a Chinese restaurant in Bethesda, Md., Downey said Weaver asked why Democrats hadn't asked McCain to switch parties.""
I know that Tom, from a conversation with him, was in conversation with a number of Republicans back then.
SEN. JOHN KERRY: ""I don't know all the details of it.
JONATHAN SINGER: ""And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what your discussions were with him [McCain] in 2004, how far it went, who approached whom... if there was any 'there' there.""
(Fox News' ""Special Report With Brit Hume,"" 4/4/07; Sen. Kerry: ""[McCain's] People Similarly Approached Me To Engage In A Discussion About His Potentially Being On The Ticket As Vice President.""
McCain says that also is a mischaracterization, and that he was never serious about leaving the Republican Party.""
This of course, follows a similar story that came out last week in which Senate Democrats where saying McCain was in serious negotiations with them about switching parties following his loss to George W. Bush in the 2000 presidential primaries.
But McCain says no, it was Kerry's idea, and that he rejected it each time it was raised.
The Politico newspaper reports Kerry maintains that McCain's people made overtures to him about a vice presidential nod.

311,"Senator Barack Obama...
Sincerely,U.S.
Senator Barack Obama today sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Paulson urging them to immediately convene a homeownership preservation summit with key stakeholders to fight foreclosures driven by growth in the subprime mortgage market.
The text of the letter is below:Dear Chairman Bernanke and Secretary Paulson,There is grave concern in low-income communities about a potential coming wave of foreclosures.
Because regulators are partly responsible for creating the environment that is leading to rising rates of home foreclosure in the subprime mortgage market I urge you immediately to convene a homeownership preservation summit with leading mortgage lenders investors loan servicing organizations consumer advocates federal regulators and housing related agencies to...
...assess options for private sector responses to the challenge...
We cannot sit on the sidelines while increasing numbers of American families face the risk of losing their homes.
And while neither the government nor the private sector acting alone is capable of quickly balancing the important interests in widespread access to credit and responsible lending, both must act and act quickly.
Working together, the relevant private sector entities and regulators may be best positioned for quick and targeted responses to mitigate the danger.
Rampant foreclosures are in nobody’s interest, and I believe this is a case where all responsible industry players can share the objective of eliminating deceptive or abusive practices, preserving homeownership, and stabilizing housing markets.

313,"And that's why it's just common sense to give the FBI the authority to keep terror suspects from buying guns and explosives.
That's why our police officers patrol sensitive locations.
We know Hasan was able to buy a handgun despite having been under investigation by the FBI for links to terrorism.
And on November 5, 2009, Major Nidal Hasan shot 43 people at Fort Hood -- killing 13.
He was charged with murder and 16 counts of terrorist acts.
At the time of the shooting, the FBI was already investigating the man after his arrest in Yemen with a fake Somali passport.
Last June in Little Rock, Arkansas, a man opened fire at a military recruiting station, killing one private and wounding another.
And, of course, attacks and planned attacks have not been limited to New York.
The second was in September, when the City and federal authorities broke up a plot to detonate explosives in the New York City subway system.
The first was last May, when the terrorists purchased guns and explosives as part of a planned attack on a Temple and Jewish Center in the Bronx.

The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses.
The ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand.
Why is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction?
So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes.
But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes.
For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax.
Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations.
Notably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the rule’s actual purpose has to do with political contributions.
But because there was little debate over the amendment or how it would influence churches, we don’t know precisely why Congress enacted the amendment.

But given the left’s apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court’s dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.
Enough is enough—our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.”Grimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage.
“Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell’s campaign,” Grimes said.

316,"And I'll protect the rights of ordinary Americans by cracking down on companies that are trying to deceive them.
I'll eliminate income taxes for seniors making less than $50,000 a year.
But many more Americans aren't falling into debt because they made an irresponsible decision; they're falling into debt because credit card companies are pushing them over the edge.
And they should have to face the consequences of those decisions.
Part of why our debt crisis is so bad is that some folks are making reckless decisions – racking up big credit card bills by purchasing flat-screen TVs and other luxury goods that they know they can't afford.
Now, let's be honest.
And bankruptcy rates have steadily climbed over the past year.
The typical family is now nearly $10,000 in the red.
Over the past 15 years, average household credit card debt has tripled.
As a result, many of them are falling deeper and deeper into debt, and a lot of that debt is being put onto credit cards.

6079 is enacted near the beginning of fiscal year 2013, CBO and JCT estimate that, on balance, the direct spending and revenue effects of enacting that legislation would cause a net increase in federal budget deficits of $109 billion over the 2013–2022 period.
...revenues from the excise tax on high premium insurance plans and net savings from other coverage related effects...
The costs of those coverage expansions which include the cost of the subsidies to be provided through the exchanges increased outlays for Medicaid and the Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP and tax credits for certain small employers will be partially offset by penalty payments from employers and uninsured individuals...
6079 because the net savings from eliminating the insurance coverage provisions would be more than offset by the combination of other spending increases and revenue reductions:The ACA contains a set of provisions designed to expand health insurance coverage, which, on net, are projected to cost the government money.

What Major Components Result in the Net Increase in Deficits?

342,"The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.
Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year – and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees – that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.
No decisions have been made, GOP sources said.
But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.
If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open.
The Associated Press and Politico first reported elements of the talks earlier Thursday.
Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.
“Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,” Messer said.

I am running for President because I believe that we need fundamental change in America.
It is a story of immigrants who set out from distant shores; pioneers who persevered; and people of all races, religions, and ethnic groups who put aside their doubts to seek a new frontier.
It is a story of ideals that know no boundaries.
The story of America leads west.
Here, in Denver, fur trappers and traders; gold rushers and ranchers; came in search of opportunity, and made the future their own.
This city, built at the base of the Rocky Mountains, stands as a monument to a uniquely American belief in things unseen.
It is fitting that the journey leads to Denver - a city that is younger than the Democratic Party itself, but filled with the promise that our Party has always fought for.
It is through campaigns that we bring new people into the process; build new coalitions; and renew who we are and what we stand for as a Party.
Because it is through campaigns that we hear directly from the American people, set our common goals, and debate our differences.

She's back together with ex Justin Bieber; she's been putting out new music; and, most recently, she dyed her signature dark hair platinum blonde.

The suit further alleges that Arreola and Sanchez were ""forced to protect [Depp] from himself and his vices while in public, becoming caretakers for him.""
Additionally, the bodyguards claim that they were ""exposed to unsafe conditions and situations"" and, as a result, they suffered ""stress-related injuries created by a hostile and unsafe work environment.""

Kate Spade New York announced plans to donate $1 million to support suicide prevention and mental health awareness causes.
Hundreds of mourners gathered at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish Redemptorist Church, with many clutching their Kate Spade bags in tribute, according to the Kansas City Star.
Tragically, Spade's father, Earl F. Brosnahan, Jr. died Wednesday night at the age of 89.
A family spokesman said he had been ""in failing health of late and was heartbroken over the recent death of his beloved daughter.""
Actress Rachel Brosnahan, his granddaughter, paid tribute to him in an Instagram post late Thursday that also mentioned Spade.
""He was a man of few words, but when he spoke a whole room leaned in.
He was tough as nails but gentle as can be, stubborn as a mule, and had a wicked sense of humor,"" she wrote.
""He will be deeply, deeply missed.

Miller was known for her strong personality and fiery interactions with her students and their parents before quitting the Lifetime reality show in March.
Prosecutors wanted Miller to spend 2.5 years in prison, while her attorneys were hoping for probation because all of her creditors were made whole after the fraud was discovered.
She also pleaded guilty to an unrelated charge of sneaking $120,000 in foreign currency into the United States from Australia, which, according to The Associated Press, she agreed to forfeit.
Last June, she pleaded guilty to purposely hiding that income.
Miller was indicted on fraud charges in 2015 for allegedly hiding from a bankruptcy court $775,000 in income she earned after filing a petition to reorganize her Pittsburgh dance studio in 2010.

If you are going to allow your daughter to watch it, discuss some of the themes beforehand.
The intense emotions, confusion, and behaviors of the show’s characters can be disturbing to any viewer.
Because of the normal stage of development at age 13, the decision whether and how your daughter should watch 13 Reasons Why is an important one.
And selling an admittedly TV-MA show to a YA readership is just as concerning as cross-marketing children’s action figures based on R-rated movies like Deadpool.
There is a real difference between your 13-year-old daughter reading the book and watching an adult filmmaker’s graphic recreation of the book.
Younger kids’ media consumption is aspirational, meaning that they look to older kids, including media representations, to see how they should act, dress, and behave in the strange new worlds of high school, summer camp, and college.
As you’ve seen with your own daughter, media made for older adolescents and adults are attractive to younger kids.
Although it is based on a popular YA novel (for readers 12-18), 13 Reasons Why is rated TV-MA (unsuitable for viewers under 17) and several episodes are preceded by an onscreen “graphic content” warning.
The problem is that she and her peers may not yet be neurodevelopmentally capable of processing that “drama” in healthy, safe ways.

Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about “anyone we know.” While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of “Swish Swish” is “liberation” from bullies.
“I think it’s a great anthem for people to use whenever someone’s trying to hold you down or bully you,” she said.
That s kind of what this record is about it s just like a 360 degree liberation If Chained to the Rhythm was about political liberation and Bon Appétit was a sexual liberation then Perry calls Swish Swish the liberation from all the negative that doesn t serve you Perry...

Go get it, girl!
In the dramatic new music video for her song ""Tell Me You Love Me,"" which dropped on Friday morning, the pop star and Grey's Anatomy actor Jesse Williams play an engaged couple who head for the aisle despite their tumultuous relationship.
You'll have to watch the entire video—clocking in at almost seven minutes—to see how the couple's relationship fares, from proposal to accusations of infidelity to exchanging rings, but it might be tough to focus on anything other than the gorgeous wedding Lovato staged for the clip.
The ceremony takes place outside, on a perfectly manicured lawn in the shade of a massive tree with drooping branches.
An entire robe-clad gospel choir stands on bleachers behind the wedding party, and the wedding guests sit in simple wooden chairs arranged in rows across the lawn, facing the flower-adorned arch where a pastor waits for Lovato to approach.
The ""Confident"" singer wears a white lace gown with flowing tiers and a strapless sweetheart neckline for her not-so-real nuptials.
Like what you see?
Lovato's wedding dress is actually Style 3659 by Lazaro and can be purchased at local Lazaro retailers for $4,290.
The (fictional) bride completed her look with dewy pink-tinted makeup, and a delicate fingertip veil.

One read is that there’s no escaping the suffocation of a subjugating regime.
Except within the show, there actually is escaping it — and yet June has decided not to.
Season 2 has been dutifully brutal, complete with ample torture, rapes, executions and murders.
It gave in to every one of the show’s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development or new interiority.

The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October.
Renee Zellweger’s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.
The claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing “sexual favors” for Weinstien, 65.
“If Harvey said that, he’s full of shit,” a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.
Weinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: “Mr.
Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them.
It’s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work.
It’s simply not true.”As previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expośes published by The New York Times and The New Yorker.
