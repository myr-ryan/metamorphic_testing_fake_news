“Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror is a relentlessly spiky and unforgiving cultural rectal probe, while Electric Dreams is a cerebrum-twistingly bonkers riff on the late great Philip K Dick’s blend of deep thinking and futuristic whimsy.”
“And who can blame them when the X-Files is currently enjoying a new lease on life, the recent return of Twin Peaks proved such an unexpected joy and even the new version of the 80s shoulderpad-fest Dynasty seems to have found its audience?”
“The Twilight Zone, however, might well be a different matter entirely.”
“According to the Hollywood Reporter, Jordan Peele, the director of Get Out, has been selected to revive the venerable, spooky old sci-fi show for CBS All Access, which one would have to admit makes a certain sort of sense.”
“Peele’s biting, horror-fuelled satire on race and richness would have made a fine episode of Rod Serling’s classic anthology series, as Serling delighted in using pulpy scenarios to brutally satirise the whirling cultural maelstrom of early 1960s society.”
“The question is whether The Twilight Zone can ever return to the intellectual heights that the original series reached over five seasons and a staggering 156 episodes between 1959 and 1964.”
“A previous 1980s revival floundered despite featuring work from celebrated writers such as George RR Martin and Harlan Ellison, and perhaps because it lacked Serling’s knack for balancing shock tactics with a strident morality and subtle liberal message.”
“Even with the presence of American Werewolf in London’s John Landis in the director’s chair and Steven Spielberg as a hands-on producer, the 1983 big screen reworking also failed to pass muster, and is now little-remembered.”
“The most recent revival, on TV between 2002 and 2003, also largely left critics unimpressed despite having recruited Oscar-winner Forest Whitaker to take over Serling’s dutiful presentation and narration.”","['Satire', 'Sensational']"
