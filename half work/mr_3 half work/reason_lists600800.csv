“But it needs lots of new jobs just to keep up with its rising population — and as those unemployment comparisons show, recent employment growth has fallen well short of what’s needed.”
“In particular, there’s a good case to be made that zoning policies in many states unnecessarily restrict the supply of housing, and that this is one area where Texas does in fact do something right.”
“But what does population growth have to do with job growth?”
“Well, the high rate of population growth translates into above-average job growth through a couple of channels.”
“Many of the people moving to Texas — retirees in search of warm winters, middle-class Mexicans in search of a safer life — bring purchasing power that leads to greater local employment.”
“At the same time, the rapid growth in the Texas work force keeps wages low — nearly 10 percent of hourly Texan workers earn the minimum wage or less, well above the national average — and these low wages give corporations an incentive to move production to the Lone Star State.”
“So Texas tends, in good years and bad, to have higher job growth than the rest of America.”

“The congregation claimed that this revocation violated the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses.”
“The ADF opposes the restriction because the rule requires churches to choose between actively participating in political campaigns, on the one hand, and accepting tax-deductible donations, on the other hand.”
“Why is the Alliance Defense Fund so interested in eliminating this restriction?”
“So a primary purpose of the 1954 amendment was to prevent donors from deducting political contributions from their taxes.”
“But organizations that qualify as charitable groups under section 501(c)(3) are special because donors to these organizations may deduct their contributions from their own federal income taxes.”
“For example, section 527 of the code exempts all sorts of political organizations from federal income tax.”
“Under the Internal Revenue Code, there are many different kinds of tax-exempt organizations.”
“Notably, the 1954 amendment is often misunderstood as limiting political advocacy, but the rule’s actual purpose has to do with political contributions.”

““It’s very good that Alison Grimes has come out in support of a policy that puts regular people in charge of government again,” says David Donnelly, who is executive director of Public Campaign Action Fund.”
“But given the left’s apoplectic reaction to the Roberts Court’s dismantling limitations and the rise of super PACs, her position is receiving applause from watchdog groups.”
“Enough is enough—our democracy is too important to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.”Grimes has played it safe on the campaign trail when faced with thornier issues outside of core Democratic principles, such as raising the minimum wage.”
““Special interest money has already flooded into Mitch McConnell’s campaign,” Grimes said.”
