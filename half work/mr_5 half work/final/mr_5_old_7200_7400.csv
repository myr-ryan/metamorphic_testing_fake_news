“Unfortunately for fans of those other series, they have not enjoyed the swift resurrection that Sense 8 received.”
“Sense8 was part of Netflix’s cancellation spree that saw fan-favorites The Get Down, Marco Polo, and the star-studded drama Bloodline canceled within eight months of each other.”
“Two days before Christmas in 2016, Netflix released a two-hour holiday special called Happy F*cking New Year.”
“At the time of its revival from cancellation, Wachowski would not rule out even more Sense8 in the future, writing, “After that … if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know.”The new two-hour special is the second of its kind in the series.”
“Despite the finality of its brief return, there’s still a sliver of hope that Sense 8 could continue on even further.”
“Either way, that point is now moot in the face of the show’s return and opportunity for closure.”
“In the letter, Wachowski stated Netflix did “love the show as much as we do, but the numbers have always been challenging.” She did not clarify if the numbers she was referring to were low viewership data, the expensive production cost, or both.”
“The letter not only revived hope of Sense8‘s return to our lives but also gave the most definitive answer as to why it was canceled in the first place.”",['Sensational']
